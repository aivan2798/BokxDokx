"What brothers?"

"Founders, mon. Elders of Zion, ya know..."

"We open that hatch, the light'll wake bossman," Case whispered.

"Make    it    special    dark,    now,"    the    man    said.    "Come.    I    an'~    I    visit    th'~
Founders."

"You know how fast I can cut you, friend?"

"Don'~ stan'~ talkin'~, sister. Come."

The two surviving Founders of Zion were old men, old with the accelerated
aging that overtakes men who spend too many years outside the embrace of
gravity.  Their  brown  legs,  brittle  with  calcium  loss,  looked  fragile  in  the
harsh   glare   of   reflected   sunlight.   They   floated   in   the   center   of   a   painted
jungle of rainbow foliage, a lurid communal mural that completely covered
the hull of the spherical chamber. The air was thick with resinous smoke.

"Steppin'~ Razor," one said, as Molly drifted into the chamber. "Like unto a
whippin'~ stick."

"That  is  a  story  we  have,  sister,"  said  the  other,  "a  religion  story.  We  are
glad you've come with Maelcum."

"How come you don't talk the patois?" Molly asked.

"I  came  from  Los  Angeles,"  the  old  man  said.  His  dreadlocks  were  like  a
matted  tree  with  branches  the  color  of  steel  wool.  "Long  time  ago,  up  the
gravity well and out of Babylon. To lead the Tribes home. Now my brother
likens you to Steppin'~ Razor."

Molly extended her right hand and the blades flashed in the smoky air.

The  other  Founder  laughed,  his  head  thrown  back.  "Soon  come,  the  Final
Days...     Voices.     Voices     cryin'~     inna     wilderness,     prophesyin'~     ruin     unto
Babylon..."

"I let you out of my sight for two hours and you score." She shook her head.
"I    hope    you're    gonna    be    ready    for    our    big    dinner    date    with    Armitage
tonight.  This  Twentieth  Century  place.  We  get  to  watch  Riviera  strut  his
stuff, too."

"Yeah," Case said, arching his back, his smile locked into a rictus of delight,
"beautiful."

"Man," she said, "if whatever that is can get in past what those surgeons did
to you in Chiba, you are gonna be in sad ass shape when it wears off."

"Bitch, bitch, bitch," he said, unbuckling his belt. "Doom. Gloom. All I ever
hear."  He  took  his  pants  off,  his  shirt,  his  underwear.  "I  think  you  oughta
have   sense   enough   to   take   advantage   of   my   unnatural   state."   He   looked
down. "I mean, _look_ at this unnatural state."

She laughed. "It won't last."

"But  it  will,"  he  said,  climbing  into  the  sand-colored  temperfoam,  "that's
what's so _unnatural_ about it."

"Case,  what's  wrong  with  you?"  Armitage  said,  as  the  waiter  was  seating
them    at    his    table    in    the    Vingtime    Sicle.    It    was    the    smallest    and    most
expensive      of      several      floating      restaurants      on      a      small      lake      near      the
Intercontinental.

Case shuddered. Bruce hadn't said anything about after effects. He tried to
pick up a glass of ice water, but his hands were shaking. "Something I ate,
maybe."

"I want you checked out by a medic," Armitage said.

"Just this hystamine reaction," Case lied. "Get it when I travel, eat different
stuff, sometimes."

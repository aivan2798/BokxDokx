Shin rummaged behind empty two-liter cans that had once been filled with
powdered   horseradish.   He   produced   a   slender   package   wrapped   in   gray
plastic. "Taser. One hour, twenty New Yen. Thirty deposit."

"Shit. I don't need that. I need a gun. Like I maybe wanna shoot somebody,
understand?"

The waiter shrugged, replacing the taser behind the horseradish cans. "Two
hour."

He    went    into    the    shop    without    bothering    to    glance    at    the    display    of
shuriken. He'd never thrown one in his life.

He bought two packs of Yeheyuans with a Mitsubishi Bank chip that gave
his  name  as  Charles  Derek  May.  It  beat  Truman  Starr,  the  best  he'd  been
able to do for a passport.

The  Japanese  woman  behind  the  terminal  looked  like  she  had  a  few  years
on old Deane, none of them with the benefit of science. He took his slender
roll  of  New  Yen  out  of  his  pocket  and  showed  it  to  her.  "I  want  to  buy  a

She gestured in the direction of a case filled with knives.

"No," he said, "I don't like knives."

She  brought  an  oblong  box  from  beneath  the  counter.  The  lid  was  yellow

while mottled brown fingers stripped the paper from one. She held the thing
up for him to examine, a dull steel tube with a leather thong at one end and
a small bronze pyramid at the other. She gripped the tube with one hand, the
pyramid  between  her  other  thumb  and  forefinger,  and  pulled.  Three  oiled,
telescoping    segments    of    tightly    wound    coilspring    slid    out    and    locked.
"Cobra," she said.

Beyond  the  neon  shudder  of  Ninsei,  the  sky  was  that  mean  shade  of  gray.
The   air   had   gotten   worse;   it   seemed   to   have   teeth   tonight,   and   half   the

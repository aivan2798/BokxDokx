The corridor narrowed suddenly, curved split.

She  turned  right  and  started  up  a  freakishly  steep  flight  of  stairs,  her  leg
beginning    to    ache.    Overhead,    strapped    and    bundled    cables    hugged    the
stairwell's  ceiling  like  colorcoded  ganglia.  The  walls  were  splotched  with
damp.

She     arrived     at     a     triangular     landing     and     stood     rubbing     her     leg.     More
corridors, narrow, their walls hung with rugs. They branched away in three
directions.

LEFT.

She shrugged. "Lemme look around, okay?"

LEFT.

"Relax. There's time." She started down the corridor that led off to her right.

STOP.

GO BACK.

DANGER.

She  hesitated.  From  the  half-open  oak  door  at  the  far  end  of  the  passage
came a voice, loud and slurred, like the voice of a drunk. Case thought the
language   might   be   French,   but   it   was   too   indistinct.   Molly   took   a   step,
another, her hand sliding into the suit to touch the butt of her fletcher. When
she stepped into the neural disruptor's field, her ears rang, a tiny rising tone
that made Case think of the sound of her fletcher. She pitched forward, her
striated  muscles  slack,  and  struck  the  door  with  her  forehead.  She  twisted
and lay on her back, her eyes unfocused, breath gone.

"What's    this,"    said    the    slurred    voice,    "fancy    dress?"    A    trembling    hand
entered  the  front  of  her  suit  and  found  the  fletcher,  tugging  it  out.  "Come
visit, child. Now."

Molly seemed to be studying the high, delicate bones, the wide mouth, the
narrow  hawk  nose.  3Jane's  eyes  were  dark,  curiously  opaque.  "Because  I
hate  him,"  she  said  at  last,  "and  the  why  of  that's  just  the  way  I'm  wired,
what he is and what I am."

"And the show," 3Jane said. "I saw the show."

Molly nodded.

"But Hideo?"

"Because  they're  the  best.  Because  one  of  them  killed  a  partner  of  mine,
once."

3Jane became very grave. She raised her eyebrows.

"Because I had to see," Molly said.

"And then we would have talked, you and I? Like this?" Her dark hair was
very  straight,  center-parted,  drawn  back  into  a  knot  of  dull  sterling.  "Shall
we talk now?"

"Take this off," Molly said, raising her captive hands.

"You killed my father," 3Jane said, no change whatever in her tone. "I was
watching on the monitors. My mother's eyes, he called them."

"He killed the puppet. It looked like you."

"He was fond of broad gestures," she said, and then Riviera was beside her,
radiant  with  drugs,  in  the  seersucker  convict  outfit  he'd  worn  in  the  roof
garden of their hotel.

"Getting acquainted? She's an interesting girl, isn't she? I thought so when I
first saw her." He stepped past 3Jane. "It isn't going to work, you know."

"Isn't it, Peter?" Molly managed a grin.

"No," he said, closing the door. "I want it tight."

"Suit yourself." She wore a dark mesh t-shirt tucked into baggy black cotton
pants.

"You  ever  the  heat,  Mr.~  Armitage?"  Case  asked,  from  where  he  sat,  his
back against a wall.

Armitage was no taller than Case, but with his broad shoulders and military
posture he seemed to fill the doorway. He wore a somber Italian suit; in his
right hand he held a briefcase of soft black calf. The Special Forces earring
was  gone.  The  handsome,  inexpressive  features  offered  the  routine  beauty
of   the   cosmetic   boutiques,   a   conservative   amalgam   of   the   past   decade's
leading  media  faces.  The  pale  glitter  of  his  eyes  heightened  the  effect  of  a
mask. Case began to regret the question.

"Lots of Forces types wound up cops, I mean. Or corporate security," Case
added  uncomfortably.  Molly  handed  him  a  steaming  mug  of  coffee.  "That
number you had them do on my pancreas, that's like a cop routine."

Armitage  closed  the  door  and  crossed  the  room,  to  stand  in  front  of  Case.
"You're a lucky boy, Case. You should thank me."

"Should I?" Case blew noisily on his coffee.

"You needed a new pancreas. The one we bought for you frees you from a
dangerous dependency."

"Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency."

"Good, because you have a new one."

"How's that?" Case looked up from his coffee. Armitage was smiling.

"You  have  fifteen  toxin  sacs  bonded  to  the  lining  of  various  main  arteries,
Case.   They're   dissolving.   Very   slowly,   but   they   definitely   are   dissolving.
Each  one  contains  a  mycotoxin.  You're  already  familiar  with  the  effect  of
that     mycotoxin.     It     was     the     one     your     former     employers     gave     you     in
Memphis."

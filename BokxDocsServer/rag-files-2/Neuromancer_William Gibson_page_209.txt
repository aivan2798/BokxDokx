was  confusing  at  first.  Molly  must  have  read  it  correctly  before  Case  had
quite assimilated it, because he felt her tense. She spat, then stood.

Children.     Feral,     in     rags.     Teeth     glittering     like     knives.     Sores     on     their
contorted faces. The soldier on his back, mouth and throat open to the sky.
They were feeding.

"Bonn,"     she     said,     something     like     gentleness     in     her     voice.     "Quite     the
product,  aren't  you,  Peter?  But  you  had  to  be.  Our  3Jane,  she's  too  jaded
now to open the back door for just any petty thief. So Wintermute dug you
up. The ultimate taste, if your taste runs that way. Demon lover. Peter." She
shivered. "But you talked her into letting me in. Thanks. Now we're gonna
party."

And then she was walking -strolling, really, in spite of the pain -away from
Riviera's   childhood.   She   drew   the   fletcher   from   its   holster,   snapped   the
plastic    magazine    out,    pocketed    that,    and    replaced    it    with    another.    She
hooked her thumb in the neck of the Modern suit and ripped it open to the
crotch with a single gesture, her thumb blade parting the tough polycarbon
like   rotten   silk.   She   freed   herself   from   the   arms   and   legs,   the   shredded
remnants disguising themselves as they fell to the dark false sand.

Case noticed the music then. A music he didn't know, all horns and piano.

The entrance to 3Jane's world had no door. It was a ragged five-meter gash
in  the  tunnel  wall,  uneven  stairs  leading  down  in  a  broad  shallow  curve.
Faint blue light, moving shadows, music.

"Case," she said, and paused, the fletcher in her right hand. Then she raised
her left, smiled, touched her open palm with a wet tongue tip, kissing him
through the simstim link. "Gotta go."

Then   there   was   something   small   and   heavy   in   her   left   hand,   her   thumb
against a tiny stud, and she was descending.

"Sister,   time,   it   be   time,   ya   know   wha   mean?   Dread,"   and   he   shook   his
locks, "at control, mon, an'~ I an'~ I come a Freeside when I an'~ I come..."

"Case,"  she  said,  "have  you  maybe  done  anything  toward  getting  in  touch
with  our  pal  from  Berne?  Like  all  that  time  you  spent  in  Zion,  plugged  in
with your lips moving?"

"Pal,"  Case  said,  "sure.  No.  I  haven't.  But  I  got  a  funny  story  along  those
lines, left over from Istanbul." He told her about the phones in the Hilton.

"Christ," she said, "there goes a chance. How come you hung up?"

"Coulda been anybody," he lied. "Just a chip... I dunno." He shrugged.

"Not just 'cause you were scared, huh?"

He shrugged again.

"Do it now."

"What?"

"Now. Anyway, talk to the Flatline about it."

"I'm  all  doped,"  he  protested,  but  reached  for  the  trodes.  His  deck  and  the
Hosaka   had   been   mounted   behind   Maelcum's   module   along   with   a   very
high-resolution Cray monitor.

He adjusted the trodes. _Marcus Garvey_ had been thrown together around
an   enormous   old   Russian   air   scrubber,   a   rectangular   thing   daubed   with
Rastafarian   symbols,   Lions   of   Zion   and   Black   Star   Liners,   the   reds   and
greens and yellows overlaying wordy decals in Cyrillic script. Someone had
sprayed   Maelcum's   pilot   gear   a   hot   tropical   pink,   scraping   most   of   the
overspray   off   the   screens   and   readouts   with   a   razor   blade.   The   gaskets
around   the   airlock   in   the   bow   were   festooned   with   semirigid   globs   and
streamers of translucent caulk, like clumsy strands of imitation seaweed. He
glanced  past  Maelcum's  shoulder  to  the  central  screen  and  saw  a  docking
display:  the  tug's  path  was  a  line  of  red  dots,  Freeside  a  segmented  green
circle. He watched the line extend itself, generating a new dot.

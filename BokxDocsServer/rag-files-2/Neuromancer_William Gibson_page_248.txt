"Yes," she said. "Morocco. When Marie-France was a girl, years before she
married  Ashpool,  she  spent  a  summer  alone  on  that  beach,  camping  in  an
abandoned blockhouse. She formulated the basis of her philosophy there."

Hideo    straightened,    slipping    the    cutters    into    his    workpants.    He    held    a
section of the arrow in either hand. Maelcum had his eyes closed, his hand
clapped tight around his bicep. "I will bandage it," Hideo said.

Case managed to fall before Riviera could level the fletcher for a clear shot.
The   darts   whined   past   his   neck   like   supersonic   gnats.   He   rolled,   seeing
Hideo pivot through yet another step of his dance, the razored point of the
arrow   reversed   in   his   hand,   shaft   flat   along   palm   and   rigid   fingers.   He
flicked  it  underhand,  wrist  blurring,  into  the  back  of  Riviera's  hand.  The
fletcher struck the tiles a meter away.

Riviera   screamed.   But   not   in   pain.   It   was   a   shriek   of   rage,   so   pure,   so
refined, that it lacked all humanity.

Twin   tight   beams   of   light,   ruby   red   needles,   stabbed   from   the   region   of
Riviera's sternum.

The ninja grunted, reeled back, hands to his eyes, then found his balance.

"Peter," 3Jane said, "Peter, what have you _done?'_

"He's blinded your clone boy," Molly said flatly.

Hideo lowered his cupped hands. Frozen on the white tile, Case saw whisps
of steam drift from the ruined eyes.

Riviera smiled.

Hideo  swung  into  his  dance,  retracing  his  steps.  When  he  stood  above  the
bow,  the  arrow,  and  the  Remington,  Riviera's  smile  had  faded.  He  bent  -
bowing, it seemed to Case -and found the bow and arrow.

"You're blind," Riviera said, taking a step backward.

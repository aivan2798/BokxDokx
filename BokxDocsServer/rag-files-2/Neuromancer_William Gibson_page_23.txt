"Hey,  sweetheart,"  said  one  of  the  joeboys,  "you  wanna  try  that  thing  on
me?"

"Don't bother aiming for the legs, Kurt," Ratz said, his tone conversational.
Case  glanced  across  the  room  and  saw  the  Brazilian  standing  on  the  bar,
aiming  a  Smith  &  Wesson  riot  gun  at  the  trio.  The  thing's  barrel,  made  of
paper-thin    alloy    wrapped    with    a    kilometer    of    glass    filament,    was    wide
enough  to  swallow  a  fist.  The  skeletal  magazine  revealed  five  fat  orange
cartridges, subsonic sandbag jellies.

"Technically nonlethal," said Ratz.

"Hey, Ratz," Case said, "I owe you one."

The bartender shrugged. "Nothing, you owe me. These," and he glowered at
Wage and the joeboys, "should know better. You don't take anybody off in
the Chatsubo."

Wage coughed. "So who's talking about taking anybody off. We just wanna
talk business. Case and me, we work together."

Case pulled the .22 out of his pocket and levelled it at Wage's crotch. "I hear
you  wanna  do  me."  Ratz's  pink  claw  closed  around  the  pistol  and  Case  let
his hand go limp.

"Look,  Case,  you  tell  me  what  the  fuck  is  going  on  with  you,  you  wig  or
something? What's this shit I'm trying to kill you?" Wage turned to the boy
on his left. "You two go back to the Namban. Wait for me."

Case   watched   as   they   crossed   the   bar,   which   was   now   entirely   deserted
except for Kurt and a drunken sailor in khakis, who was curled at the foot
of a barstool. The barrel of the Smith & Wesson tracked the two to the door,
then swung back to cover Wage. The magazine of Case's pistol clattered on
the  table.  Ratz  held  the  gun  in  his  claw  and  pumped  the  round  out  of  the
chamber.

"Who told you I was going to hit you, Case?" Wage asked.

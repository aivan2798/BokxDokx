"What's  inside,  boss?"  Riviera  leaned  forward,  craning  his  neck.  Four  tiny
figures glittered, near the tip of Armitage's finger. Armitage slapped at them
as if they were gnats.

"Peter,"   Armitage   said,   "you're   going   to   be   the   first   to   find   out.   You'll
arrange yourself an invitation. Once you're in, you see that Molly gets in."

Case  stared  at  the  blankness  that  represented  Straylight,  remembering  the
Finn's story: Smith, Jimmy, the talking head, and the ninja.

"Details available?" Riviera asked. "I need to plan a wardrobe, you see."

"Learn   the   streets,"   Armitage   said,   returning   to   the   center   of   the   model.
"Desiderata Street here. This is the Rue Jules Verne."

Riviera rolled his eyes.

While    Armitage    recited    the    names    of    Freeside    avenues,    a    dozen    bright
pustules rose on his nose, cheeks, and chin. Even Molly laughed.

Armitage paused, regarded them all with his cold empty eyes.

"Sorry," Riviera said, and the sores flickered and vanished.

Case    woke,    late    into    the    sleeping    period,    and    became    aware    of    Molly
crouched  beside  him  on  the  foam.  He  could  feel  her  tension.  He  lay  there
confused. When she moved, the sheer speed of it stunned him. She was up
and through the sheet of yellow plastic before he'd had time to realize she'd
slashed it open.

"Don't you move, friend."

Case rolled over and put his head through the rent in the plastic. "Wha...?"

"Shut up."

"You th'~ one, mon," said a Zion voice. "Cateye, call 'em, call 'em Steppin'~
Razor. I Maelcum, sister. Brothers wan'~ converse wi'~ you an'~ cowboy."

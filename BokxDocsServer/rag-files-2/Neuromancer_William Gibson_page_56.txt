head   stared   vacantly   into   space,   a   dozen   spikes   of   microsoft   protruding
from the socket behind his ear.

"Larry, you in, man?" She positioned herself in front of him. The boy's eyes
focused. He sat up in his chair and pried a bright magenta splinter from his
socket with a dirty thumbnail.

"Hey, Larry."

"Molly." He nodded.

"I have some work for some of your friends, Larry."

Larry   took   a   flat   plastic   case   from   the   pocket   of   his   red   sportshirt   and
flicked    it    open,    slotting    the    microsoft    beside    a    dozen    others.    His    hand
hovered, selected a glossy black chip that was slightly longer than the rest,
and inserted it smoothly into his head. His eyes narrowed.

"Molly's got a rider," he said, "and Larry doesn't like that."

"Hey,"   she   said,   "I   didn't   know   you   were   so...   sensitive.   I'm   impressed.
Costs a lot, to get that sensitive."

"I  know  you,  lady?"  The  blank  look  returned.  "You  looking  to  buy  some
softs?"

"I'm looking for the Moderns."

"You      got      a      rider,      Molly.      This      says."      He      tapped      the      black      splinter.
"Somebody else using your eyes."

"My partner."

"Tell your partner to go."

"Got something for the Panther Moderns, Larry."

"What are you talking about, lady?"

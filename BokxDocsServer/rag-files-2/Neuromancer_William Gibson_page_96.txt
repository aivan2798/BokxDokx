the quickness of his smile. His teeth were small, even, and very white. Case
watched the white hands play over the imitation fragments of sculpture.

Riviera didn't act like a man who'd been attacked the night before, drugged
with  a  toxin-flechette,  abducted,  subjected  to  the  Finn's  examination,  and
pressured by Armitage into joining their team.

Case checked his watch. Molly was due back from her drug run. He looked
up at Riviera again. "I bet you're stoned right now, asshole," he said to the
Hilton   lobby.   A   graying   Italian   matron   in   a   white   leather   tuxedo   jacket
lowered her Porsche glasses to stare at him. He smiled broadly, stood, and
shouldered   his   bag.   He   needed   cigarettes   for   the   flight.   He   wondered   if
there was a smoking section on the _JAL_ shuttle. "See ya, lady," he said to
the woman, who promptly slid the sunglasses back up her nose and turned
away.

There   were   cigarettes   in   the   gift   shop,   but   he   didn't   relish   talking   with
Armitage  or  Riviera.  He  left  the  lobby  and  located  a  vending  console  in  a
narrow alcove, at the end of a rank of pay phones.

He fumbled through a pocketful of lirasi, slotting the small dull alloy coins
one after another, vaguely amused by the anachronism of the process. The
phone nearest him rang.

Automatically, he picked it up.

"Yeah?"

Faint harmonics, tiny inaudible voices rattling across some orbital link, and
then a sound like wind.

"Hello, Case."

A fifty-lirasi coin fell from his hand, bounced, and rolled out of sight across
Hilton carpeting.

"Wintermute, Case. It's time we talk."

It was a chip voice.

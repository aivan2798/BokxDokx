Cart?"   It   remained   stationary.   The   Braun   was   plucking   at   the   leg   of   his
jeans, nipping at his ankle. He resisted a strong urge to kick it. "Yeah?"

It ticked its way around the door. He followed it.

The  monitor  in  the  library  was  another  Sony,  as  old  as  the  first  one.  The
Braun paused beneath it and executed a sort of jig.

"Wintermute?"

The familiar features filled the screen. The Finn smiled.

"Time  to  check  in,  Case,"  the  Finn  said,  his  eyes  screwed  up  against  the
smoke of a cigarette. "C'mon, jack."

The   Braun   threw   itself   against   his   ankle   and   began   to   climb   his   leg,   its
manipulators   pinching   his   flesh   through   the   thin   black   cloth.   "Shit!"   He
slapped   it   aside   and   it   struck   the   wall.   Two   of   its   limbs   began   to   piston
repeatedly,   uselessly,   pumping   the   air.   "What's   wrong   with   the   goddam
thing?"

"Burned out," the Finn said. "Forget it. No problem. Jack in now."

There were four sockets beneath the screen, but only one would accept the
Hitachi adaptor.

He jacked in.

Nothing. Gray void.

No matrix, no grid. No cyberspace.

The deck was gone. His fingers were...

And  on  the  far  rim  of  consciousness,  a  scurrying,  a  fleeting  impression  of
something rushing toward him, across leagues of black mirror.

He tried to scream.

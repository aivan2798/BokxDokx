"Oh," Case said. "Yeah? No shit?"

"No shit."

And then the screen was blank.

He left the vodka on the cabinet. He packed his things. She'd bought him a
lot    of    clothes    he    didn't    really    need,    but    something    kept    him    from    just
leaving  them  there.  He  was  closing  the  last  of  the  expensive  calfskin  bags
when he remembered the shuriken. Pushing the flask aside, he picked it up,
her first gift.

"No," he said, and spun, the star leaving his fingers, flash of silver, to bury
itself   in   the   face   of   the   wall   screen.   The   screen   woke,   random   patterns
flickering  feebly  from  side  to  side,  as  though  it  were  trying  to  rid  itself  of
something that caused it pain.

"I don't need you," he said.

He spent the bulk of his Swiss account on a new pancreas and liver, the rest
on a new Ono-Sendai and a ticket back to the Sprawl.

He found work.

He found a girl who called herself Michael.

And    one    October    night,    punching    himself    past    the    scarlet    tiers    of    the
Eastern  Seaboard  Fission  Authority,  he  saw  three  figures,  tiny,  impossible,
who  stood  at  the  very  edge  of  one  of  the  vast  steps  of  data.  Small  as  they
were, he could make out the boy's grin, his pink gums, the glitter of the long
gray eyes that had been Riviera's. Linda still wore his jacket; she waved, as
he passed. But the third figure, close behind her, arm across her shoulders,
was himself.

Somewhere, very close, the laugh that wasn't laughter.

He never saw Molly again.

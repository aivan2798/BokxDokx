"Molly,    love,"    Riviera    said,    almost    before    he    was    settled    on    his    chair,
"you'll have to dole me out more of the medicine. I'm out."

"Peter,"  she  said,  "and  what  if  I  won't?"  She  smiled  without  showing  her
teeth.

"You will," Riviera said, his eyes cutting to Armitage and back.

"Give it to him," Armitage said.

"Pig for it, aren't you?" She took a flat, foil-wrapped packet from an inside
pocket and flipped it across the table. Riviera caught it in midair. "He could
off himself," she said to Armitage.

"I have an audition this afternoon," Riviera said. "I'll need to be at my best."
He cupped the foil packet in his upturned palm and smiled. Small glittering
insects  swarmed  out  of  it,  vanished.  He  dropped  it  into  the  pocket  of  his
seersucker blouse.

"You've got an audition yourself, Case, this afternoon," Armitage said. "On
that tug. I want you to get over to the pro shop and get yourself fitted for a
vac  suit,  get  checked  out  on  it,  and  get  out  to  the  boat.  You've  got  about
three hours."

"How  come  we  get  shipped  over  in  a  shitcan  and  you  two  hire  a  _JAL_
taxi?" Case asked, deliberately avoiding the man's eyes.

"Zion suggested we use it. Good cover, when we move. I do have a larger
boat, standing by, but the tug is a nice touch."

"How about me?" Molly asked. "I got chores today?"

"I    want    you    to    hike    up    the    far    end    to    the    axis,    work    out    in    zero-g.
Tomorrow, maybe, you can hike in the opposite direction." Straylight, Case
thought.

"How soon?" Case asked, meeting the pale stare.

"Soon," Armitage said. "Get going, Case."

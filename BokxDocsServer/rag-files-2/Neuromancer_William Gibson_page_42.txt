PART TWO - THE SHOPPING EXPEDITION

Home.

Home was BAMA, the Sprawl, the Boston-Atlanta Metropolitan Axis.

Program    a    map    to    display    frequency    of    data    exchange,    every    thousand
megabytes   a   single   pixel   on   a   very   large   screen.   Manhattan   and   Atlanta
burn  solid  white.  Then  they  start  to  pulse,  the  rate  of  traffic  threatening  to
overload your simulation. Your map is about to go nova. Cool it down. Up
your      scale.      Each      pixel      a      million      megabytes.      At      a      hundred      million
megabytes  per  second,  you  begin  to  make  out  certain  blocks  in  midtown
Manhattan,   outlines   of   hundred-year-old   industrial   parks   ringing   the   old
core of Atlanta...

Case woke from a dream of airports, of Molly's dark leathers moving ahead
of    him    through    the    concourses    of    Narita,    Schipol,    Orly...    He    watched
himself   buy   a   flat   plastic   flask   of   Danish   vodka   at   some   kiosk,   an   hour
before dawn.

Somewhere    down    in    the    Sprawl's    ferro-concrete    roots,    a    train    drove    a
column of stale air through a tunnel. The train itself was silent, gliding over
its induction cushion, but displaced air made the tunnel sing, bass down into
subsonics. Vibration reached the room where he lay and caused dust to rise
from the cracks in the dessicated parquet floor.

Opening   his   eyes,   he   saw   Molly,   naked   and   just   out   of   reach   across   an
expanse of very new pink temperfoam. Overhead, sunlight filtered through
the soot-stained grid of a skylight. One half-meter square of glass had been
replaced with chipboard, a fat gray cable emerging there to dangle within a
few centimeters of the floor. He lay on his side and watched her breathe, her
breasts, the sweep of a flank defined with the functional elegance of a war
plane's fusilage. Her body was spare, neat, the muscles like a dancer's.

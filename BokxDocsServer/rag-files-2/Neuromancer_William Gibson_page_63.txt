Out now. Reversing smoothly, the virus reknitting the fabric of the window.

Done.

In    the    Sense/Net    lobby,    two    Panther    Moderns    sat    alertly    behind    a    low
rectangular  planter,  taping  the  riot  with  a  video  camera.  They  both  wore
chameleon  suits.  "Tacticals  are  spraying  foam  barricades  now,"  one  noted,
speaking  for  the  benefit  of  his  throat  mike.  "Rapids  are  still  trying  to  land
their copter."

Case  hit  the  simstim  switch.  And  flipped  into  the  agony  of  broken  bone.
Molly was braced against the blank gray wall of a long corridor, her breath
coming ragged and uneven. Case was back in the matrix instantly, a white-
hot line of pain fading in his left thigh.

"What's happening, Brood?" he asked the link man.

"I dunno, Cutter. Mother's not talking. Wait."

Case's   program   was   cycling.   A   single   hair-fine   thread   of   crimson   neon
extended  from  the  center  of  the  restored  window  to  the  shifting  outline  of
his icebreaker. He didn't have time to wait. Taking a deep breath, he flipped

Molly took a single step, trying to support her weight on the corridor wall.
In  the  loft,  Case  groaned.  The  second  step  took  her  over  an  outstretched
arm.     Uniform     sleeve     bright     with     fresh     blood.     Glimpse     of     a     shattered
fiberglass   shockstave.   Her   vision   seemed   to   have   narrowed   to   a   tunnel.
With the third step, Case screamed and found himself back in the matrix.

"Brood?   Boston,   baby..."   Her   voice   tight   with   pain.   She   coughed.   "Little
problem with the natives. Think one of them broke my leg."

"What  you  need  now,  Cat  Mother?"  The  link  man's  voice  was  indistinct,
nearly lost behind static.

Case  forced  himself  to  flip  back.  She  was  leaning  against  the  wall,  taking
all of her weight on her right leg. She fumbled through the contents of the

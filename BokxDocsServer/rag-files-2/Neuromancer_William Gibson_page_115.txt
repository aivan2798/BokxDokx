"Maybe... how long since you seen me?"

"Hey, it's a put-on, right?" She peered at him. "Right?"

"No. Some kind of blackout. I... I woke up in the alley."

"Maybe somebody decked you, baby. Got your roll intact?"

He shook his head.

"There you go. You need a place to sleep, Case?"

"I guess so."

"Come on, then." She took his hand. "We'll get you a coffee and something
to eat. Take you home. It's good to see you, man." She squeezed his hand.

He smiled.

Something cracked.

Something shifted at the core of things. The arcade froze, vibrated -

She    was    gone.    The    weight    of    memory    came    down,    an    entire    body    of
knowledge  driven  into  his  head  like  a  microsoft  into  a  socket.  Gone.  He
smelled burning meat.

The sailor in the white t-shirt was gone. The arcade was empty, silent. Case
turned  slowly,  his  shoulders  hunched,  teeth  bared,  his  hands  bunched  into
involuntary  fists.  Empty.  A  crumpled  yellow  candy  wrapper,  balanced  on
the edge of a console, dropped to the floor and lay amid flattened butts and
styrofoam cups.

"I  had  a  cigarette,"  Case  said,  looking  down  at  his  white  knuckled  fist.  "I
had a cigarette and a girl and a place to sleep. Do you hear me, you son of a
bitch? You hear me?"

Echoes  moved  through  the  hollow  of  the  arcade,  fading  down  corridors  of
consoles.

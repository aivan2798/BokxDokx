""We.'" He met the faded blue eyes. ""We" who?"

"What  would  you  say  if  I  told  you  we  could  correct  your  neural  damage,
Case?" Armitage suddenly looked to Case as if he were carved from a block
of  metal;  inert,  enormously  heavy.  A  statue.  He  knew  now  that  this  was  a
dream,   and   that   soon   he'd   wake.   Armitage   wouldn't   speak   again.   Case's

"Scared,  Case.  You're  real  scared."  It  was  Sunday  afternoon  and  he  stood
with Molly in a sort of courtyard. White boulders, a stand of green bamboo,
black gravel raked into smooth waves. A gardener, a thing like a large metal
crab, was tending the bamboo.

"It'll work Case. You got no idea, the kind of stuff Armitage has. Like he's
gonna   pay   these   nerve   boys   for   fixing   you   with   the   program   he's   giving

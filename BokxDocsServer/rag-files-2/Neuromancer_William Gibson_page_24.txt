"Who told you, man? Somebody trying to set you up?"

The sailor moaned and vomited explosively.

"Get him out of here," Ratz called to Kurt, who was sitting on the edge of
the bar now, the Smith & Wesson across his lap, lighting a cigarette.

Case felt the weight of the night come down on him like a bag of wet sand
settling behind his eyes. He took the flask out of his pocket and handed it to
Wage. "All I got. Pituitaries. Get you five hundred if you move it fast. Had
the rest of my roll in some RAM, but that's gone by now."

"You okay, Case?" The flask had already vanished behind a gunmetal lapel.
"I mean, fine, this'll square us, but you look bad. Like hammered shit. You

were   vanishing   like   ghosts,   and   most   of   the   neon   was   already   cold   and
dead. He sipped thick black coffee from a street vendor's foam thimble and
watched  the  sun  come  up.  "You  fly  away,  honey.  Towns  like  this  are  for
people   who   like   the   way   down."   But   that   wasn't   it,   really,   and   he   was
finding    it    increasingly    hard    to    maintain    the    sense    of    betrayal.    She    just

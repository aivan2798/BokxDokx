Now   she   straddled   him   again,   took   his   hand,   and   closed   it   over   her,   his
thumb along the cleft of her buttocks, his fingers spread across the labia. As
she    began    to    lower    herself,    the    images    came    pulsing    back,    the    faces,
fragments of neon arriving and receding. She slid down around him and his
back arched convulsively. She rode him that way, impaling herself, slipping

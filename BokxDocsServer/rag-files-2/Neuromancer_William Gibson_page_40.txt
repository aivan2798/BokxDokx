Blood sprayed from a jugular in a red gout of light. And now the crowd was
screaming, rising, screaming -as one figure crumpled, the hologram fading,
flickering...

Raw  edge  of  vomit  in  his  throat.  He  closed  his  eyes,  took  a  deep  breath,
opened  them,  and  saw  Linda  Lee  step  past  him,  her  gray  eyes  blind  with
fear. She wore the same French fatigues.

And gone. Into shadow.

Pure mindless reflex: he threw the beer and chicken down and ran after her.
He might have called her name, but he'd never be sure.

Afterimage  of  a  single  hair-fine  line  of  red  light.  Seared  concrete  beneath
the thin soles of his shoes.

Her  white  sneakers  flashing,  close  to  the  curving  wall  now,  and  again  the

convulsively, and toppled across Case's legs.

He    was    walking    toward    the    stalls,    into    the    shadows.    He    looked    down,
expecting  to  see  that  needle  of  ruby  emerge  from  his  chest.  Nothing.  He

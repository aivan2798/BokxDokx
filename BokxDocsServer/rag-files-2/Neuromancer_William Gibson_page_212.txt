"Hideo,"  said  another  voice,  a  woman's,  "she's  losing  consciousness.  Give
her   something.   For   that   and   for   the   pain.   She's   very   striking,   don't   you

laughed. "I made it easy for him. To annoy the others. He was a pretty boy,
my burglar. Is she waking, Hideo? Shouldn't she have more?"

"You scream, mon, while ago."

"Molly," he said, his throat dry. "Got hurt." He took a white plastic squeeze
bottle from the edge of the g-web and sucked out a mouthful of flat water.
"I don't like how any of this shit is going."

The   little   Cray   monitor   lit.   The   Finn,   against   a   background   of   twisted,
impacted junk. "Neither do I. We gotta problem."

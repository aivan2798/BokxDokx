"Just thinking out loud... How smart's an AI, Case?"

"Depends.     Some     aren't     much     smarter     than     dogs.     Pets.     Cost     a     fortune
anyway. The real smart ones are as smart as the Turing heat is willing to let
'em get."

"Look, you're a cowboy. How come you aren't just flat out fascinated with
those things?"

"Well," he said, "for starts, they're rare. Most of them are military, the bright
ones,   and   we   can't   crack   the   ice.   That's   where   ice   all   comes   from,   you
know? And then there's the Turing cops, and that's bad heat." He looked at
her. "I dunno, it just isn't part of the trip."

"Jockeys all the same," she said. "No imagination."

They  came  to  a  broad  rectangular  pond  where  carp  nuzzled  the  stems  of

where the little waves are too broad, we can't see the rock that hit the center.
We know something's there, but not why. I wanna know why. I want you to
go and talk to Wintermute."

"I couldn't get near it," he said. "You're dreaming."

"Try."

"Can't be done."

"Ask the Flatline."

"What   do   we   want   out   of   that   Riviera?"   he   asked,   hoping   to   change   the
subject.

She  spat  into  the  pond.  "God  knows.  I'd  as  soon  kill  him  as  look  at  him.  I
saw   his   profile.   He's   a   kind   of   compulsive   Judas.   Can't   get   off   sexually

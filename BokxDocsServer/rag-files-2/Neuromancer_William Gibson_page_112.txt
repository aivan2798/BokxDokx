Mean shit, that ice."

"And your EEG was flat."

"Well, that's the stuff of legend, ain't it?"

Case   jacked   out.   "Shit,"   he   said,   "how   do   you   think   Dixie   got   himself
flatlined, huh? Trying to buzz an AI. Great..."

"Go on," she said, "the two of you are supposed to be dynamite, right?"

"Dix," Case said, "I wanna have a look at an AI in Berne. Can you think of
any reason not to?"

"Not unless you got a morbid fear of death, no."

Case  punched  for  the  Swiss  banking  sector,  feeling  a  wave  of  exhilaration
as     cyberspace     shivered,     blurred,     gelled.     The     Eastern     Seaboard     Fission
Authority   was   gone,   replaced   by   the   cool   geometric   intricacy   of   Zurich
commercial banking. He punched again, for Berne.

"Up," the construct said. "It'll be high."

They ascended lattices of light, levels strobing, a blue flicker.

That'll be it, Case thought.

Wintermute      was      a      simple      cube      of      white      light,      that      very      simplicity
suggesting extreme complexity.

"Don't look much, does it?" the Flatline said. "But just you try and touch it."

"I'm going in for a pass, Dixie."

"Be my guest."

Case punched to within four grid points of the cube. Its blank face, towering
above  him  now,  began  to  seethe  with  faint  internal  shadows,  as  though  a
thousand dancers whirled behind a vast sheet of frosted glass.

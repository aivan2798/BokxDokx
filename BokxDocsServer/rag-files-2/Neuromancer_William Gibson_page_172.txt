"~At the Villa's silicon core is a small room, the only rectilinear chamber in
the    complex.    Here,    on    a    plain    pedestal    of    glass,    rests    an    ornate    bust,
platinum and cloisonn, studded with lapis and pearl. The bright marbles of
its eyes were cut from the synthetic ruby viewport of the ship that brought
the first Tessier up the well, and returned for the first Ashpool..."

The head fell silent.

"Well?" Case asked, finally almost expecting the thing to answer him.

"That's all she wrote," the Finn said. "Didn't finish it. Just a kid then. This
thing's  a  ceremonial  terminal,  sort  of.  I  need  Molly  in  here  with  the  right
word  at  the  right  time.  That's  the  catch.  Doesn't  mean  shit,  how  deep  you
and the Flatline ride that Chinese virus, if this thing doesn't hear the magic
word."

"So what's the word?"

"I don't know. You might say what I am is basically defined by the fact that
I   don't   know,   because   I   _can't_   know.   I   am   that   which   knoweth   not   the
word. If you knew, man, and told me, I couldn't _know._ It's hardwired in.
Someone   else   has   to   learn   it   and   bring   it   here,   just   when   you   and   the
Flatline punch through that ice and scramble the cores."

"What happens then?"

"I don't exist, after that. I cease."

"Okay by me," Case said.

"Sure. But you watch your ass, Case. My, ah, other lobe is on to us, it looks
like.  One  burning  bush  looks  pretty  much  like  another.  And  Armitage  is
starting to go."

"What's that mean?"

But    the    paneled    room    folded    itself    through    a    dozen    impossible    angles,
tumbling away into cyberspace like an origami crane.

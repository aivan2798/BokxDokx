Hideo stepped out of the shadows, a third arrow ready in a slender bamboo
bow. He bowed.

Maelcum stared, his hand still on the steel shaft.

"The artery is intact," the ninja said. Case remembered Molly's description
of the man who'd killed her lover. Hideo was another. Ageless, he radiated a
sense  of  quiet,  an  utter  calm.  He  wore  clean,  frayed  khaki  workpants  and
soft dark shoes that fit his feet like gloves, split at the toes like tabi socks.
The   bamboo   bow   was   a   museum   piece,   but   the   black   alloy   quiver   that
protruded  above  his  left  shoulder  had  the  look  of  the  best  Chiba  weapons
shops. His brown chest was bare and smooth.

"You cut my thumb, mon, wi'~ secon'~ one," Maelcum said.

"Coriolis force," the ninja said, bowing again. "Most difficult, slow-moving
projectile in rotational gravity. It was not intended."

"Where's  3Jane?"  Case  crossed  to  stand  beside  Maelcum.  He  saw  that  the
tip of the arrow in the ninja's bow was like a double-edged razor. "Where's
Molly?"

"Hello, Case." Riviera came strolling out of the dark behind Hideo, Molly's
fletcher  in  his  hand.  "I  would  have  expected  Armitage,  somehow.  Are  we
hiring help out of that Rasta cluster now?"

"Armitage is dead."

"Armitage never existed, more to the point, but the news hardly comes as a
shock."

"Wintermute killed him. He's in orbit around the spindle."

Riviera   nodded,   his   long   gray   eyes   glancing   from   Case   to   Maelcum   and
back. "I think it ends here, for you," he said.

"Where's Molly?"

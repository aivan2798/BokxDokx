Armitage.

Confused images of wasps and spiders rose in Case's mind as they came in
sight of _Marcus Garvey._ The little tug was snug against the gray thorax of
a sleek, insectile ship five times her length. The arms of grapples stood out
against _Garvey_'s patched hull with the strange clarity of vacuum and raw
sunlight.    A    pale    corrugated    gangway    curved    out    of    the    yacht,    snaked
sideways  to  avoid  the  tug's  engines,  and  covered  the  aft  hatch.  There  was
something obscene about the arrangement, but it had more to do with ideas
of feeding than of sex.

"What's happening with Maelcum?"

"Maelcum  fine.  Nobody  come  down  the  tube.  Yacht  pilot  talk  to  him,  say
relax."

As  they  swung  past  the  gray  ship,  Case  saw  the  name  HANIWA  in  crisp
white capitals beneath an oblong cluster of Japanese.

"I don't like this, man. I was thinking maybe it's time we got our ass out of
here anyway."

"Maelcum thinkin'~ that precise thing, mon, but _Garvey_ not be goin'~ far
like that."

Maelcum   was   purring   a   speeded-up   patois   to   his   radio   when   Case   came
through the forward lock and removed his helmet.

"Aerol's gone back to the _Rocker,'_ Case said.

Maelcum nodded, still whispering to the microphone.

Case pulled himself over the pilot's drifting tangle of dreadlocks and began
to   remove   his   suit.   Maelcum's   eyes   were   closed   now;   he   nodded   as   he
listened  to  some  reply  over  a  pair  of  phones  with  bright  orange  pads,  his
brow  creased  with  concentration.  He  wore  ragged  jeans  and  an  old  green
nylon jacket with the sleeves ripped out. Case snapped the red Sanyo suit to
a storage hammock and pulled himself down to the g-web.

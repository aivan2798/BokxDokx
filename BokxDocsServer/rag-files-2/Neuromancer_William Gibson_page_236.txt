"He  _said_  you  would,"  she  said,  wrinkling  her  nose.  She  shrugged.  "He
knows stuff like that, I guess." She lifted her left foot and rubbed salt from
the     other     ankle,     awkward,     childlike.     She     smiled     at     him     again,     more
tentatively. "Now you answer me one, okay?"

He nodded.

"How come you're painted brown like that, all except your foot."

"And that's the last thing you remember?" He watched her scrape the last of
the  freeze-dried  hash  from  the  rectangular  steel  box  cover  that  was  their
only plate.

She nodded, her eyes huge in the firelight. "I'm sorry, Case, honest to God.
It  was  just  the  shit,  I  guess,  an'~  it  was..."  She  hunched  forward,  forearms
across    her    knees,    her    face    twisted    for    a    few    seconds    with    pain    or    its
memory.  "I  just  needed  the  money.  To  get  home,  I  guess,  or...  hell,"  she
said, "you wouldn't hardly talk to me."

"There's no cigarettes?"

"God_dam,_  Case,  you  asked  me  that  ten  times  today!  What's  wrong  with
you?" She twisted a strand of hair into her mouth and chewed at it.

"But the food was here? It was already here?"

"I _told_ you, man, it was washed up on the damn beach."

"Okay. Sure. It's seamless."

She  started  to  cry  again,  a  dry  sobbing.  "Well,  damn  you  anyway,  Case,"
she managed, finally, "I was doin'~ just fine here by myself."

He got up, taking his jacket, and ducked through the doorway, scraping his
wrist on rough concrete. There was no moon, no wind, sea sound all around
him  in  the  darkness.  His  jeans  were  tight  and  clammy.  "Okay,"  he  said  to
the  night,  "I  buy  it.  I  guess  I  buy  it.  But  tomorrow  some  cigarettes  better
wash   up."   His   own   laughter   startled   him.   "A   case   of   beer   wouldn't   hurt,
while you're at it." He turned and re-entered the bunker.

now you get to find out just how tight those jeans really are, huh?"

Case   sat   in   the   loft   with   the   dermatrodes   strapped   across   his   forehead,
watching  motes  dance  in  the  diluted  sunlight  that  filtered  through  the  grid
overhead.    A    countdown    was    in    progress    in    one    corner    of    the    monitor
screen.

Cowboys   didn't   get   into   simstim,   he   thought,   because   it   was   basically   a
meat    toy.    He    knew    that    the    trodes    he    used    and    the    little    plastic    tiara
dangling     from     a     simstim     deck     were     basically     the     same,     and     that     the
cyberspace     matrix     was     actually     a     drastic     simplification     of     the     human
sensorium, at least in terms of presentation, but simstim itself struck him as
a gratuitous multiplication of flesh input. The commercial stuff was edited,
of course, so that if Tally Isham got a headache in the course of a segment,
you didn't feel it.

The screen bleeped a two-second warning.

The     new     switch     was     patched     into     his     Sendai     with     a     thin     ribbon     of
fiberoptics.

And one and two and -

Cyberspace     slid     into     existence     from     the     cardinal     points.     Smooth,     he
thought, but not smooth enough. Have to work on it...

Then he keyed the new switch.

The  abrupt  jolt  into  other  flesh.  Matrix  gone,  a  wave  of  sound  and  color...
She   was   moving   through   a   crowded   street,   past   stalls   vending   discount
software,  prices  feltpenned  on  sheets  of  plastic,  fragments  of  music  from
countless   speakers.   Smells   of   urine,   free   monomers,   perfume,   patties   of
frying krill. For a few frightened seconds he fought helplessly to control her
body.  Then  he  willed  himself  into  passivity,  became  the  passenger  behind
her eyes.

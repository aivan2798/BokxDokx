console. Streamlined Japanese was stenciled across the side of the console
in faded pinks and yellows.

He glanced up and saw a sooty plastic window, a faint glow of fluorescents.

His back hurt, his spine.

He got to his feet, brushed wet hair out of his eyes.

Something had happened...

He   searched   his   pockets   for   money,   found   nothing,   and   shivered.   Where
was his jacket? He tried to find it, looked behind the console, but gave up.

On   Ninsei,   he   took   the   measure   of   the   crowd.   Friday.   It   to   be   a   Friday.
Linda was probably in the arcade. Might have money, or at least cigarettes...
Coughing,  wringing  rain  from  the  front  of  his  shirt,  he  edged  through  the
crowd to the arcade's entrance.

Holograms    twisted    and    shuddered    to    the    roaring    of    the    games,    ghosts
overlapping  in  the  crowded  haze  of  the  place,  a  smell  of  sweat  and  bored
tension.  A  sailor  in  a  white  t-shirt  nuked  Bonn  on  a  Tank  War  console,  an
azure flash.

She   was   playing   Wizard's   Castle,   lost   in   it,   her   gray   eyes   rimmed   with
smudged black paintstick.

She looked up as he put his arm around her, smiled. "Hey. How you doin'~?
Look wet."

He kissed her.

"You   made   me   blow   my   game,"   she   said.   "Look   there,   asshole.   Seventh
level    dungeon    and    the    goddam    vampires    got    me."    She    passed    him    a
cigarette. "You look pretty strung, man. Where you been?"

"I don't know."

"You high, Case? Drinkin'~ again? Eatin'~ Zone's dex?"

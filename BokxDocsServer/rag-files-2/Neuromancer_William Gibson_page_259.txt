wide open to some of the stuff they got running loose in here."

"Hate," Case said. "Who do I hate? You tell me."

"Who do you love?" the Finn's voice asked.

He whipped the program through a turn and dived for the blue towers.

Things      were      launching      themselves      from      the      ornate      sunburst      spires,
glittering     leech     shapes     made     of     shifting     planes     of     light.     There     were
hundreds of them, rising in a whirl, their movements random as windblown
paper down dawn streets. "Glitch systems," the voice said.

He  came  in  steep,  fueled  by  self-loathing.  When  the  Kuang  program  met
the  first  of  the  defenders,  scattering  the  leaves  of  light,  he  felt  the  shark
thing lose a degree of substantiality, the fabric of information loosening.

And then -old alchemy of the brain and its vast pharmacy -his hate flowed
into his hands.

In  the  instant  before  he  drove  Kuang's  sting  through  the  base  of  the  first
tower, he attained a level of proficiency exceeding anything he'd known or
imagined.  Beyond  ego,  beyond  personality,  beyond  awareness,  he  moved,
Kuang    moving    with    him,    evading    his    attackers    with    an    ancient    dance,
Hideo's     dance,     grace     of     the     mind-body     interface     granted     him,     in     that
second, by the clarity and singleness of his wish to die.

And   one   step   in   that   dance   was   the   lightest   touch   on   the   switch,   barely
enough to flip -

_-now_

and his voice the cry of a bird unknown,

3Jane answering in song, three notes, high and pure.

A true name.

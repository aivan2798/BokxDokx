board,    change    any    codes    they    find    posted.    Kids'll    steal    the    new    ones
tomorrow."

Case  tapped  his  way  into  Bell  Europa  and  switched  to  a  standard  phone
code. With the Flatline's help, he connected with the London data base that
Molly claimed was Armitage's.

"Here,"  said  the  voice,  "I'll  do  it  for  you."  The  Flatline  began  to  chant  a
series of digits, Case keying them on his deck, trying to catch the pauses the
construct used to indicate timing. It took three tries.

"Big deal," said the Flatline. "No ice at all."

"Scan this shit," Case told the Hosaka. "Sift for owner's personal history."

The neuroelectronic scrawls of the paradise vanished, replaced by a simple
lozenge of white light. "Contents are primarily video recordings of postwar
military   trials,"   said   the   distant   voice   of   the   Hosaka.   "Central   figure   is
Colonel Willis Corto."

Two hours later, Case fell beside Molly on the slab and let the temperfoam

records, reeling smoothly down the screen, too quickly, and Case had had to
ask     the     computer     to     read     them     for     him.     Other     segments     were     audio
recordings of the Screaming Fist hearing.

Willis  Corto,  Colonel,  had  plummeted  through  a  blind  spot  in  the  Russian
defenses over Kirensk. The shuttles had created the hole with pulse bombs,

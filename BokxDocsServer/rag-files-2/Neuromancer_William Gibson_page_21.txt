house rules in seven languages. Case took the pink handset from its cradle
and  punched  a  Hongkong  number  from  memory.  He  let  it  ring  five  times,
then hung up. His buyer for the three megabytes of hot RAM in the Hitachi
wasn't taking calls.

He punched a Tokyo number in Shinjuku.

A woman answered, something in Japanese.

"Snake Man there?"

"Very good to hear from you," said Snake Man, coming in on an extension.
"I've been expecting your call."

"I got the music you wanted." Glancing at the cooler.

"I'm very glad to hear that. We have a cash flow problem. Can you front?"

"Oh, man, I really need the money bad..."

Snake Man hung up.

"You shit," Case said to the humming receiver. He stared at the cheap little
pistol.

"Iffy," he said, "it's all looking very iffy tonight."

Case walked into the Chat an hour before dawn, both hands in the pockets
of his jacket: one held the rented pistol, the other the aluminum flask.

Ratz was at a rear table, drinking Apollonaris water from a beer pitcher, his
hundred    and    twenty    kilos    of    doughy    flesh    tilted    against    the    wall    on    a
creaking  chair.  A  Brazilian  kid  called  Kurt  was  on  the  bar,  tending  a  thin
crowd  of  mostly  silent  drunks.  Ratz's  plastic  arm  buzzed  as  he  raised  the
pitcher and drank. His shaven head was filmed with sweat. "You look bad,
friend artiste," he said, flashing the wet ruin of his teeth.

"I'm  doing  just  fine,"  said  Case,  and  grinned  like  a  skull.  "Super  fine."  He
sagged into the chair opposite Ratz, hands still in his pockets.

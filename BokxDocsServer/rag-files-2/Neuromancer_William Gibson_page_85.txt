"Yeah," she said, "I know who that is." She jerked her head in the direction
of the elevators. "Come on, cowboy." Case followed her with both bags.

Their     room     might     have     been     the     one     in     Chiba     where     he'd     first     seen
Armitage. He went to the window, in the morning, almost expecting to see
Tokyo Bay. There was another hotel across the street. It was still raining. A
few    letter-writers    had    taken    refuge    in    doorways,    their    old    voiceprinters
wrapped    in    sheets    of    clear    plastic,    evidence    that    the    written    word    still
enjoyed a certain prestige here. It was a sluggish country. He watched a dull
black  Citroen  sedan,  a  primitive  hydrogen-cell  conversion,  as  it  disgorged
five     sullen-looking     Turkish     officers     in     rumpled     green     uniforms.     They
entered the hotel across the street.

He glanced back at the bed, at Molly, and her paleness struck him. She'd left
the    micropore    cast    on    the    bedslab    in    their    loft,    beside    the    transdermal
inducer. Her glasses reflected part of the room's light fixture.

He  had  the  phone  in  his  hand  before  it  had  a  chance  to  ring  twice.  "Glad
you're up," Armitage said.

"I'm just. Lady's still under. Listen, boss, I think it's maybe time we have a
little talk. I think I work better if I know a little more about what I'm doing."

Silence on the line. Case bit his lip.

"You know as much as you need to. Maybe more."

"You think so?"

"Get dressed, Case. Get her up. You'll have a caller in about fifteen minutes.
His name is Terzibashjian." The phone bleated softly. Armitage was gone.

"Wake up, baby," Case said. "Biz."

"I've been awake an hour already." The mirrors turned.

"We got a Jersey Bastion coming up."

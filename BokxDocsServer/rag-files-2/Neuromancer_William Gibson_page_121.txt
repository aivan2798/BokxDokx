minute, make sure the money stays here when the people fall back down the
well."

Armitage    had    booked    them    into    a    place    called    the    Intercontinental,    a
sloping glass-fronted cliff face that slid down into cold mist and the sound
of  rapids.  Case  went  out  onto  their  balcony  and  watched  a  trio  of  tanned
French  teenagers  ride  simple  hang  gliders  a  few  meters  above  the  spray,
triangles of nylon in bright primary colors. One of them swung, banked, and
Case  caught  a  flash  of  cropped  dark  hair,  brown  breasts,  white  teeth  in  a
wide smile. The air here smelled of running water and flowers. "Yeah," he
said, "lotta money."

She   leaned   beside   him   against   the   railing,   her   hands   loose   and   relaxed.
"Yeah.    We    were    gonna    come    here    once,    either    here    or    some    place    in
Europe."

"We who?"

"Nobody," she said, giving her shoulders an involuntary toss. "You said you
wanted to hit the bed. Sleep. I could use some sleep."

"Yeah," Case said, rubbing his palms across his cheekbones. "Yeah, this is
some place."

The     narrow     band     of     the     Lado-Acheson     system     smoldered     in     abstract
imitation  of  some  Bermudan  sunset,  striped  by  shreds  of  recorded  cloud.
"Yeah," he said, "sleep."

Sleep  wouldn't  come.  When  it  did,  it  brought  dreams  that  were  like  neatly
edited segments of memory. He woke repeatedly, Molly curled beside him,
and heard the water, voices drifting in through the open glass panels of the
balcony, a woman's laughter from the stepped condos on the opposite slope.
Deane's death kept turning up like a bad card, no matter if he told himself
that it hadn't been Deane. That it hadn't, in fact, happened at all. Someone
had once told him that the amount of blood in the average human body was
roughly equivalent to a case of beer.

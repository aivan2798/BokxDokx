"What was that you were telling her, when I came back?" Riviera was very
close now.

"About  my  mother.  She  asked  me  to.  I  think  she  was  in  shock,  aside  from
Hideo's injection. Why did you do that to her?"

"I wanted to see if they would break."

"One  did.  When  she  comes  around  -if  she  comes  around  -we'll  see  what
color her eyes are."

"She's extremely dangerous. Too dangerous. If I hadn't been here to distract
her, to throw up Ashpool to distract her and my own Hideo to draw her little
bomb, where would you be? In her power."

"No,"   3Jane   said,   "there   was   Hideo.   I   don't   think   you   quite   understand
about Hideo. She does, evidently."

"Like a drink?"

"Wine. The white."

Case jacked out.

Maelcum was hunched over _Garvey_'s controls, tapping out commands for
a    docking    sequence.    The    module's    central    screen    displayed    a    fixed    red

_Garvey_ and _Haniwa_ as they approached the curvature of the spindle.

"We got an hour, man," Case said, pulling the ribbon of fiberoptics from the
Hosaka. His deck's back-up batteries were good for ninety minutes, but the
Flatline's     construct     would     be     an     additional     drain.     He     worked     quickly,
mechanically, fastening the construct to the bottom of the Ono-Sendai with
micropore tape. Maelcum's workbelt drifted past. He snagged it, unclipped
the two lengths of shock cord, with their gray rectangular suction pads, and
hooked the jaws of one clip through the other. He held the pads against the

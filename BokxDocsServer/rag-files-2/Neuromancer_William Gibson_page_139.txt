shuddering and turning, the onlookers clapping in time. But that had needed
a van full of gear and a clumsy trode helmet.

What  Riviera  dreamed,  you  got.  Case  shook  his  aching  head  and  spat  into
the lake.

He    could    guess    the    end,    the    finale.    There    was    an    inverted    symmetry:
Riviera   puts   the   dreamgirl   together,   the   dreamgirl   takes   him   apart.   With
those hands. Dreamblood soaking the rotten lace.

Cheers from the restaurant, applause. Case stood and ran his hands over his
clothes. He turned and walked back into the Vingtime Sicle.

Molly's  chair  was  empty.  The  stage  was  deserted.  Armitage  sat  alone,  still
staring at the stage, the stem of the wineglass between his fingers.

"Where is she?" Case asked.

"Gone," Armitage said.

"She go after him?"

"No." There was a soft _tink._ Armitage looked down at the glass. His left
hand  came  up  holding  the  bulb  of  glass  with  its  measure  of  red  wine.  The
broken stem protruded like a sliver of ice. Case took it from him and set it
in a water glass.

"Tell me where she went, Armitage."

The  lights  came  up.  Case  looked  into  the  pale  eyes.  Nothing  there  at  all.
"She's  gone  to  prepare  herself.  You  won't  see  her  again.  You'll  be  together
during the run."

"Why did Riviera do that to her?"

Armitage stood, adjusting the lapels of his jacket. "Get some sleep, Case."

"We run, tomorrow?"

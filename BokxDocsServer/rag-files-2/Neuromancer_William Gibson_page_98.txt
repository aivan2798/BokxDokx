PART THREE - MIDNIGHT IN THE RUE

Archipelago.

The     islands.     Torus,     spindle,     cluster.     Human     DNA     spreading     out     from
gravity's steep well like an oilslick.

Call up a graphics display that grossly simplifies the exchange of data in the
L-5  archipelago.  One  segment  clicks  in  as  red  solid,  a  massive  rectangle
dominating your screen.

Freeside.  Freeside  is  many  things,  not  all  of  them  evident  to  the  tourists
who  shuttle  up  and  down  the  well.  Freeside  is  brothel  and  banking  nexus,
pleasure  dome  and  free  port,  border  town  and  spa.  Freeside  is  Las  Vegas
and   the   hanging   gardens   of   Babylon,   an   orbital   Geneva   and   home   to   a
family inbred and most carefully refined, the industrial clan of Tessier and
Ashpool.

On the _THY_ liner to Paris, they sat together in First Class, Molly in the
window seat, Case beside her, Riviera and Armitage on the aisle. Once, as
the  plane  banked  over  water,  Case  saw  the  jewel-glow  of  a  Greek  island
town. And once, reaching for his drink, he caught the flicker of a thing like
a giant human sperm in the depths of his bourbon and water.

Molly  leaned  across  him  and  slapped  Riviera's  face,  once.  "No,  baby.  No
games. You play that subliminal shit around me, I'll hurt you real bad. I can
do it without damaging you at all. I _like_ that."

Case  turned  automatically  to  check  Armitage's  reaction.  The  smooth  face
was  calm,  the  blue  eyes  alert,  but  there  was  no  anger.  "That's  right,  Peter.
Don't."

Case   turned   back,   in   time   to   catch   the   briefest   flash   of   a   black   rose,   its
petals sheened like leather, the black stem thorned with bright chrome.

Neon forest, rain sizzling across hot pavement. The smell of frying food. A
girl's hands locked across the small of his back, in the sweating darkness of
a portside coffin.

But   all   of   this   receding,   as   the   cityscape   recedes:   city   as   Chiba,   as   the
ranked data of Tessier-Ashpool S.A., as the roads and crossroads scribed on
the face of a microchip, the sweatstained pattern on a folded, knotted scarf...

Waking to a voice that was music, the platinum terminal piping melodically,
endlessly, speaking of numbered Swiss accounts, of payment to be made to
Zion  via  a  Bahamian  orbital  bank,  of  passports  and  passages,  and  of  deep
and basic changes to be effected in the memory of Turing.

Turing.     He     remembered     stenciled     flesh     beneath     a     projected     sky,     spun
beyond an iron railing. He remembered Desiderata Street.

And  the  voice  sang  on,  piping  him  back  into  the  dark,  but  it  was  his  own
darkness, pulse and blood, the one where he'd always slept, behind his eyes
and no other's.

And  he  woke  again,  thinking  he  dreamed,  to  a  wide  white  smile  framed
with gold incisors, Aerol strapping him into a g-web in _Babylon Rocker._

And then the long pulse of Zion dub.

She was gone. He felt it when he opened the door of their suite at the Hyatt.
Black   futons,   the   pine   floor   polished   to   a   dull   gloss,   the   paper   screens
arranged with a care bred over centuries. She was gone.

There was a note on the black lacquer bar cabinet beside the door, a single
sheet of stationery, folded once, weighted with the shuriken. He slid it from
beneath the nine-pointed star and opened it.

And Ratz was there, and Linda Lee, Wage and Lonny Zone, a hundred faces
from   the   neon   forest,   sailors   and   hustlers   and   whores,   where   the   sky   is
poisoned silver, beyond chainlink and the prison of the skull.

Goddamn don't you move.

Where the sky faded from hissing static to the noncolor of the matrix, and
he glimpsed the shuriken, his stars.

"Stop it, Case, I gotta find your vein!"

She was straddling his chest, a blue plastic syrette in one hand. "You don't
lie still, I'll slit your fucking throat. You're still full of endorphin inhibitors."

He woke and found her stretched beside him in the dark.

His   neck   was   brittle,   made   of   twigs.   There   was   a   steady   pulse   of   pain
midway down his spine. Images formed and reformed: a flickering montage
of the Sprawl's towers and ragged Fuller domes, dim figures moving toward

'cause  you  got  a  new  pancreas  thrown  into  the  deal.  And  some  new  tissue
patched  into  your  liver.  The  nerve  stuff,  I  dunno.  Lot  of  injections.  They
didn't have to open anything up for the main show." She settled back beside
him. "It's 2:43:12 AM, Case. Got a readout chipped into my optic nerve."

He   sat   up   and   tried   to   sip   from   the   bottle.   Gagged,   coughed,   lukewarm
water spraying his chest and thighs.

"I gotta punch deck," he heard himself say. He was groping for his clothes.

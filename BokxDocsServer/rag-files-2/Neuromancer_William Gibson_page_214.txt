word out of her, kill Riviera, get the key from Molly. You can keep track of
the  program  by  jacking  your  deck  into  the  Straylight  system.  I'll  handle  it
for you. There's a standard jack in the back of the head, behind a panel with
five zircons."

"Kill Riviera?"

"Kill him."

Case   blinked   at   the   representation   of   the   Finn.   He   felt   Maelcum   put   his
hand on his shoulder. "Hey. You forget something." He felt the rage rising,
and a kind of glee. "You fucked up. You blew the controls on the grapples
when you blew Armitage. _Haniwa_'s got us good and tight. Armitage fried
the other Hosaka and the mainframes went with the bridge, right?"

The Finn nodded.

"So we're stuck out here. And that means you're fucked, man." He wanted
to laugh, but it caught in his throat.

"Case, mon," Maelcum said softly, _"Garvey_ a tug."

"That's right," said the Finn, and smiled.

"You havin'~ fun in the big world outside?" the construct asked, when Case
jacked back in. "Figured that was Wintermute requestin'~ the pleasure..."

"Yeah. You bet. Kuang okay?"

"Bang on. Killer virus."

"Okay. Got some snags, but we're working on it."

"You wanna tell me, maybe?"

"Don't have time."

"Well, boy, never mind me, I'm just dead anyway."

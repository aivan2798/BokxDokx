"McCoy   Pauley   has   his   wish,"   the   boy   said,   and   smiled.   "His   wish   and
more.     He     punched     you     here     against     my     wish,     drove     himself     through
defenses equal to anything in the matrix. Now flip."

And Case was alone in Kuang's black sting, lost in cloud.

He flipped.

Into  Molly's  tension,  her  back  like  rock,  her  hands  around  3Jane's  throat.
"Funny,"   she   said,   "I   know   exactly   what   you'd   look   like.   I   saw   it   after
Ashpool  did  the  same  thing  to  your  clone  sister."  Her  hands  were  gentle,
almost    a    caress.    3Jane's    eyes    were    wide    with    terror    and    lust;    she    was
shivering with fear and longing. Beyond the freefall tangle of 3Jane's hair,
Case  saw  his  own  strained  white  face,  Maelcum  behind  him,  brown  hands
on  the  leather-jacketed  shoulders,  steadying  him  above  the  carpet's  pattern
of woven circuitry.

"Would you?" 3Jane asked, her voice a child's. "I think you would."

"The code," Molly said. "Tell the head the code."

Jacking out.

"She wants it," he screamed, "the bitch _wants_ it!"

He opened his eyes to the cool ruby stare of the terminal, its platinum face
crusted with pearl and lapis. Beyond it, Molly and 3Jane twisted in a slow
motion embrace.

"Give  us  the  fucking  code,"  he  said.  "If  you  don't,  what'll  change?  What'll
ever fucking change for you? You'll wind up like the old man. You'll tear it
all  down  and  start  building  again!  You'll  build  the  walls  back,  tighter  and
tighter...   I   got   no   idea   at   all   what'll   happen   if   Wintermute   wins,   but   it'll
_change_ something!" He was shaking, his teeth chattering.

3Jane went limp, Molly's hands still around her slender throat, her dark hair
drifting, tangled, a soft brown caul.

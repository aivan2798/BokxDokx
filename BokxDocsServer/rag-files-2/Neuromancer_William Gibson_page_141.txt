Maelcum answered on the fifth tone. "Yo?"

"Case. You got a modem, Maelcum?"

"Yo. On th'~ navigation comp, ya know."

"Can you get it off for me, man? Put it on my Hosaka. Then turn my deck
on. It's the stud with the ridges on it."

"How you doin'~ in there, mon?"

"Well, I need some help."

"Movin'~, mon. I get th'~ modem."

Case listened to faint static while Maelcum attached the simple phone link.
"Ice this," he told the Hosaka, when he heard it beep.

"You     are     speaking     from     a     heavily     monitored     location,"     the     computer
advised primly.

"Fuck it," he said. "Forget the ice. No ice. Access the construct. Dixie?"

"Hey,    Case."    The    Flatline    spoke    through    the    Hosaka's    voice    chip,    the
carefully engineered accent lost entirely.

"Dix,  you're  about  to  punch  your  way  in  here  and  get  something  for  me.
You  can  be  as  blunt  as  you  want.  Molly's  in  here  somewhere  and  I  wanna
know where. I'm in 335W, the Intercontinental. She was registered here too,
but  I  don't  know  what  name  she  was  using.  Ride  in  on  this  phone  and  do
their records for me."

"No   sooner   said,"   the   Flatline   said.   Case   heard   the   white   sound   of   the
invasion.  He  smiled.  "Done.  Rose  Kolodny.  Checked  out.  Take  me  a  few
minutes to screw their security net deep enough to get a fix."

"Go."

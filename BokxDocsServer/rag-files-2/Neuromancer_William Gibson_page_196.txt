"Systems   crash?"   The   Zionite   flicked   a   gloved   finger   at   the   column   of
zeros.

"No,"     Case     said,     grabbing     for     his     drifting     helmet,     "the     Flatline     said
Armitage wiped the Hosaka he had in there."

"Smell like he wipe 'em wi'~ laser, ya know?" The Zionite braced his foot
against  the  white  cage  of  a  Swiss  exercise  machine  and  shot  through  the
floating maze of paper, batting it away from his face.

"Case, mon..."

The  man  was  small,  Japanese,  his  throat  bound  to  the  back  of  the  narrow
articulated chair with a length of some sort of fine steel wire. The wire was
invisible, where it crossed the black temperfoam of the headrest, and it had
cut as deeply into his larynx. A single sphere of dark blood had congealed
there   like   some   strange   precious   stone,   a   red-black   pearl.   Case   saw   the
crude  wooden  handles  that  drifted  at  either  end  of  the  garrotte,  like  worn
sections of broom handle.

"Wonder  how  long  he  had  that  on  him?"  Case  said,  remembering  Corto's
postwar pilgrimage.

"He know how pilot boat, Case, bossman?"

"Maybe. He was Special Forces."

"Well,  this  Japan-boy,  he  not  be  pilotin'~.  Doubt  I  pilot  her  easy  myself.
Ver'~ new boat..."

"So find us the bridge."

Maelcum frowned, rolled backward, and kicked.

over  and  saw  a  fat  bundle  of  elastic  cable.  "Gotta  play  house,"  she  said.
"You help me string this up." He looked around the wide, featureless space
and noticed steel rings welded on every surface, seemingly at random.

When    they'd    strung    the    cables,    according    to    some    complex    scheme    of
Molly's,   they   hung   them   with   battered   sheets   of   yellow   plastic.   As   they
worked,  Case  gradually  became  aware  of  the  music  that  pulsed  constantly
through the cluster. It was called dub, a sensuous mosaic cooked from vast
libraries   of   digitalized   pop;   it   was   worship,   Molly   said,   and   a   sense   of
community. Case heaved at one of the yellow sheets; the thing was light but
still awkward. Zion smelled of cooked vegetables, humanity, and ganja.

"Good," Armitage said, gliding loose-kneed through the hatch and nodding
at the maze of sheets. Riviera followed, less certain in the partial gravity.

"Where were you when it needed doing?" Case asked Riviera.

The   man   opened   his   mouth   to   speak.   A   small   trout   swam   out,   trailing
impossible bubbles. It glided past Case's cheek. "In the head," Riviera said,
and smiled.

Case laughed.

"Good,"  Riviera  said,  "you  can  laugh.  I  would  have  tried  to  help  you,  but
I'm    no    good    with    my    hands."    He    held    up    his    palms,    which    suddenly
doubled. Four arms, four hands.

"Just the harmless clown, right, Riviera?" Molly stepped between them.

"Yo," Aerol said, from the hatch, "you wan'~ come wi'~ me, cowboy mon."

"It's your deck," Armitage said, "and the other gear. Help him get it in from
the cargo bay."

"You ver'~ pale, mon," Aerol said, as they were guiding the foam-bundled
Hosaka      terminal      along      the      central      corridor.      "Maybe      you      wan'~      eat
somethin'~."

Case's mouth flooded with saliva; he shook his head.

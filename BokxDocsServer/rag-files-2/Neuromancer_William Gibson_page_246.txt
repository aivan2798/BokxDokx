The ninja relaxed his pull on the fine, braided string, lowering the bow. He
crossed   the   tiles   to   where   the   Remington   lay   and   picked   it   up.   "This   is
without subtlety," he said, as if to himself. His voice was cool and pleasant.
His every move was part of a dance, a dance that never ended, even when
his body was still, at rest, but for all the power it suggested, there was also a
humility, an open simplicity.

"It ends here for her, too," Riviera said.

"Maybe 3Jane won't go for that, Peter," Case said, uncertain of the impulse.
The derms still raged in his system, the old fever starting to grip him, Night
City craziness. He remembered moments of grace, dealing out on the edge
of   things,   where   he'd   found   that   he   could   sometimes   talk   faster   than   he
could think.

The gray eyes narrowed. "Why, Case? Why do you think that?"

Case  smiled.  Riviera  didn't  know  about  the  simstim  rig.  He'd  missed  it  in
his hurry to find the drugs she carried for him. But how could Hideo have
missed it? And Case was certain the ninja would never have let 3Jane treat
Molly without first checking her for kinks and concealed weapons. No, he
decided, the ninja knew. So 3Jane would know as well.

"Tell me, Case," Riviera said, raising the pepperbox muzzle of the fletcher.

Something creaked, behind him, creaked again. 3Jane pushed Molly out of
the     shadows     in     an     ornate     Victorian     bathchair,     its     tall,     spidery     wheels
squeaking    as    they    turned.    Molly    was    bundled    deep    in    a    red    and    black
striped blanket, the narrow, caned back of the antique chair towering above
her. She looked very small. Broken. A patch of brilliantly white micropore
covered  her  damaged  lens;  the  other  flashed  emptily  as  her  head  bobbed
with the motion of the chair.

"A familiar face," 3Jane said, "I saw you the night of Peter's show. And who
is this?"

"Maelcum," Case said.

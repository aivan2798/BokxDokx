"Time,"  the  man  said,  straightening  up,  "and  counting.  You  know  the  rate,
Moll."

"We need a scan, Finn. For implants."

"So  get  over  there  between  the  pylons.  Stand  on  the  tape.  Straighten  up,
yeah.  Now  turn  around,  gimme  a  full  threesixty."  Case  watched  her  rotate
between  two  fragile-looking  stands  studded  with  sensors.  The  man  took  a
small  monitor  from  his  pocket  and  squinted  at  it.  "Something  new  in  your
head,  yeah.  Silicon,  coat  of  pyrolitic  carbons.  A  clock,  right?  Your  glasses
gimme    the    read    they    always    have,    low-temp    isotropic    carbons.    Better
biocompatibility with pyrolitics, but that's your business, right? Same with
your claws."

"Get   over   here,   Case."   He   saw   a   scuffed   X   in   black   on   the   white   floor.
"Turn around. Slow."

"Guy's a virgin." The man shrugged. "Some cheap dental work, is all."

"You read for biologicals?" Molly unzipped her green vest and took off the
dark glasses.

"You   think   this   is   the   Mayo?   Climb   on   the   table,   kid,   we'll   run   a   little
biopsy." He laughed, showing more of his yellow teeth. "Nah. Finn's word,
sweetmeat,  you  got  no  little  bugs,  no  cortex  bombs.  You  want  me  to  shut
the screen down?"

"Just for as long as it takes you to leave, Finn. Then we'll want full screen
for as long as we want it."

"Hey, that's fine by the Finn, Moll. You're only paying by the second."

They sealed the door behind him and Molly turned one of the white chairs
around and sat on it, chin resting on crossed forearms. "We talk now. This is
as private as I can afford."

"What about?"

"What we're doing."

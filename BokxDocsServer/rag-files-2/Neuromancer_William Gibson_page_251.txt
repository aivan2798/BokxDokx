"Chubb  lock,"  Molly  said,  her  voice  muffled  by  Maelcum's  shoulder,  "and
we got the fucking key, no fear."

"That chip of yours still working?" Case asked her.

"It's eight twenty-five, PM, Greenwich fucking Mean," she said.

"We  got  five  minutes,"  Case  said,  as  the  door  snapped  open  behind  3Jane.
She  flipped  backward  in  a  slow  somersault,  the  pale  folds  of  her  djellaba
billowing around her thighs.

They were at the axis, the core of Villa Straylight.

Molly fished the key out on its loop of nylon.

"You   know,"   3Jane   said,   craning   forward   with   interest,   "I   was   under   the
impression   that   no   duplicate   existed.   I   sent   Hideo   to   search   my   father's
things, after you killed him. He couldn't find the original."

"Wintermute managed to get it stuck in the back of a drawer," Molly said,
carefully     inserting     the     Chubb     key's     cylindrical     shaft     into     the     notched
opening  in  the  face  of  the  blank,  rectangular  door.  "He  killed  the  little  kid
who put it there." The key rotated smoothly when she tried it.

"The head," Case said, "there's a panel in the back of the head. Zircons on
it. Get it off. That's where I'm jacking in."

And then they were inside.

"Christ  on  a  crutch,"  the  Flatline  drawled,  "you  do  believe  in  takin'~  your
own good time, don't you, boy?"

"Kuang's ready?"

"Hot to trot."

"Okay." He flipped.

"You    tryin'~    to    break    my    record,    son?"    the    Flatline    asked.    "You    were
braindead again, five seconds."

"Sit tight," Case said, and hit the simstim switch.

She crouched in darkness, her palms against rough concrete.

CASE     CASE     CASE     CASE.     The     digital     display     pulsed     his     name     in
alphanumerics, Wintermute informing her of the link.

"Cute,"    she    said.    She    rocked    back    on    her    heels    and    rubbed    her    palms

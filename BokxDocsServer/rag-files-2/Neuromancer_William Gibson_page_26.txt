"No."

"Want some dry ice? All I got, right now."

"What got into you tonight? Why'd you pull that scene at the arcade? I had
to mess up this rentacop came after me with nunchucks."

"Linda said you were gonna kill me."

"Linda said? I never saw her before I came up here."

"You aren't with Wage?"

She   shook   her   head.   He   realized   that   the   glasses   were   surgically   inset,
sealing   her   sockets.   The   silver   lenses   seemed   to   grow   from   smooth   pale
skin  above  her  cheekbones,  framed  by  dark  hair  cut  in  a  rough  shag.  The
fingers curled around the fletcher were slender, white, tipped with polished
burgundy.   The   nails   looked   artificial.   "I   think   you   screwed   up,   Case.   I
showed up and you just fit me right into your reality picture."

"So what do you want, lady?" He sagged back against the hatch.

"You. One live body, brains still somewhat intact. Molly, Case. My name's
Molly.  I'm  collecting  you  for  the  man  I  work  for.  Just  wants  to  talk;  is  all.
Nobody wants to hurt you."

"That's good."

"'Cept    I    do    hurt    people    sometimes,    Case.    I    guess    it's    just    the    way    I'm
wired." She wore tight black gloveleather jeans and a bulky black jacket cut
from  some  matte  fabric  that  seemed  to  absorb  light.  "If  I  put  this  dartgun
away,    will    you    be    easy,    Case?    You    look    like    you    like    to    take    stupid
chances."

"Hey, I'm very easy. I'm a pushover, no problem."

"That's  fine,  man."  The  fletcher  vanished  into  the  black  jacket.  "Because
you    try    to    fuck    around    with    me,    you'll    be    taking    one    of    the    stupidest
chances of your whole life."

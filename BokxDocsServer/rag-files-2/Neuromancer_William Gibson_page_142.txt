The  phone  whined  and  clicked  with  the  construct's  efforts.  Case  carried  it
back into the room and put the receiver face up on the temperfoam. He went
into  the  bathroom  and  brushed  his  teeth.  As  he  was  stepping  back  out,  the
monitor  on  the  room's  Braun  audiovisual  complex  lit  up.  A  Japanese  pop
star    reclining    against    metallic    cushions.    An    unseen    interviewer    asked    a
question   in   German.   Case   stared.   The   screen   jumped   with   jags   of   blue
interference. "Case, baby, you lose your mind, man?" The voice was slow,
familiar.

The glass wall of the balcony clicked in with its view of Desiderata, but the
street scene blurred, twisted, became the interior of the Jarre de Th, Chiba,
empty, red neon replicated to scratched infinity in the mirrored walls.

Lonny  Zone  stepped  forward,  tall  and  cadaverous,  moving  with  the  slow
undersea grace of his addiction. He stood alone among the square tables, his
hands   in   the   pockets   of   his   gray   sharkskin   slacks.   "Really,   man,   you're
lookin'~ very scattered."

The voice came from the Braun's speakers.

"Wintermute," Case said.

The pimp shrugged languidly and smiled.

"Where's Molly?"

"Never  you  mind.  You're  screwing  up  tonight,  Case.  The  Flatline's  ringing
bells   all   over   Freeside.   I   didn't   think   you'd   do   that,   man.   It's   outside   the
profile."

"So tell me where she is and I'll call him off."

Zone shook his head.

"You can't keep too good track of your women, can you, Case. Keep losin'~
'em, one way or another."

"I'll bring this thing down around your ears," Case said.

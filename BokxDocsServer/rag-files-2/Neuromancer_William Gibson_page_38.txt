"How's that? You want one?" He held the pill out to her.

"Your   new   pancreas,   Case,   and   those   plugs   in   your   liver.   Armitage   had
them    designed    to    bypass    that    shit."    She    tapped    the    octagon    with    one
burgundy        nail.        "You're        biochemically        incapable        of        getting        off        on
amphetamine or cocaine."

"Shit," he said. He looked at the octagon, then at her.

"Eat it. Eat a dozen. Nothing'll happen."

He did. Nothing did.

Three beers later, she was asking Ratz about the fights.

"Sammi's," Ratz said.

"I'll pass," Case said, "I hear they kill each other down there."

An hour later, she was buying tickets from a skinny Thai in a white t-shirt
and baggy rugby shorts.

Sammi's was an inflated dome behind a portside warehouse, taut gray fabric
reinforced with a net of thin steel cables. The corridor, with a door at either
end, was a crude airlock preserving the pressure differential that supported
the     dome.     Fluorescent     rings     were     screwed     to     the     plywood     ceiling     at
intervals,  but  most  of  them  had  been  broken.  The  air  was  damp  and  close
with the smell of sweat and concrete.

None   of   that   prepared   him   for   the   arena,   the   crowd,   the   tense   hush,   the
towering puppets of light beneath the dome. Concrete sloped away in tiers
to a kind of central stage, a raised circle ringed with a glittering thicket of
projection gear. No light but the holograms that shifted and flickered above
the    ring,    reproducing    the    movements    of    the    two    men    below.    Strata    of
cigarette smoke rose from the tiers, drifting until it struck currents set up by
the blowers that supported the dome. No sound but the muted purring of the
blowers and the amplified breathing of the fighters.

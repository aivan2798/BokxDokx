cigarettes. "In your shirt," she said.

"You  want  to  answer  my  question?"  He  fished  a  wrinkled  Yeheyuan  from
the pack and she lit it for him with a thin slab of German steel that looked
as though it belonged on an operating table.

"Well, I'll tell you, the man's definitely on to something. He's got big money
now,   and   he's   never   had   it   before,   and   he   gets   more   all   the   time."   Case
noticed a certain tension around her mouth. "Or maybe, maybe something's
on to him..." She shrugged.

"What's that mean?"

"I   don't   know,   exactly.   I   know   I   don't   know   who   or   what   we're   really
working for."

He  stared  at  the  twin  mirrors.  Leaving  the  Hilton,  Saturday  morning,  he'd
gone  back  to  Cheap  Hotel  and  slept  for  ten  hours.  Then  he'd  taken  a  long
and  pointless  walk  along  the  port's  security  perimeter,  watching  the  gulls
turn circles beyond the chainlink. If she'd followed him, she'd done a good
job of it. He'd avoided Night City. He'd waited in the coffin for Armitage's
call. Now this quiet courtyard, Sunday afternoon, this girl with a gymnast's
body and conjurer's hands.

"If   you'll   come   in   now,   sir,   the   anesthetist   is   waiting   to   meet   you."   The
technician bowed, turned, and reentered the clinic without waiting to see if
Case would follow.

Cold steel odor. Ice caressed his spine.

Lost, so small amid that dark, hands grown cold, body image fading down
corridors of television sky.

Voices.

Then  black  fire  found  the  branching  tributaries  of  the  nerves,  pain  beyond
anything to which the name of pain is given...

Hold still. Don't move.

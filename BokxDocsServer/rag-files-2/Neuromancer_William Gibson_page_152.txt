"I never screw up." He lit his cigarette.

"I saw that girl you're with. Day I met you. Walks like Hideo. Scares me."
She smiled too widely. "I like that. She like it with girls?"

"Never said. Who's Hideo?"

"3Jane's, what she calls it, retainer. Family retainer."

Case forced himself to stare dully at the Emergency crowd while he spoke.
"Dee-Jane?"

"Lady 3Jane. She's triff. Rich. Her father owns all this."

"This bar?"

"Freeside!"

"No  shit.  You  keepin'~  some  class  company,  huh?"  He  raised  an  eyebrow.
Put his arm around her, his hand on her hip. "So how you meet these aristos,
Cathy?  You  some  kinda  closet  deb?  You  an'~  Bruce  secret  heirs  to  some
ripe old credit? Huh?" He spread his fingers, kneading the flesh beneath the
thin black cloth. She squirmed against him. Laughed.

"Oh,    you    know,"    she    said,    lids    half    lowered    in    what    must    have    been
intended as a look of modesty, "she likes to party. Bruce and I, we make the
party circuit... It gets real boring for her, in there. Her old man lets her out
sometimes, as long as she brings Hideo to take care of her."

"Where's it get boring?"

"Straylight, they call it. She told me, oh, it's pretty, all the pools and lilies.
It's  a  castle,  a  real  castle,  all  stone  and  sunsets."  She  snuggled  in  against
him. "Hey, Lupus, man, you need a derm. So we can be together."

She wore a tiny leather purse on a slender neck-thong. Her nails were bright
pink against her boosted tan, bitten to the quick. She opened the purse and
withdrew  a  paperbacked  bubble  with  a  blue  derm  inside.  Something  white
tumbled to the floor; Case stooped and picked it up. An origami crane.

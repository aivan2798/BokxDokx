"Say. I... Colonel?"

"Hang in there, boy. Remember your training."

_But  where  have  you  been,  man?_  he  silently  asked  the  anguished  eyes.
Wintermute  had  built  something  called  Armitage  into  a  catatonic  fortress
named  Corto.  Had  convinced  Corto  that  Armitage  was  the  real  thing,  and
Armitage had walked, talked, schemed, bartered data for capital, fronted for
Wintermute   in   that   room   in   the   Chiba   Hilton...   And   now   Armitage   was
gone,  blown  away  by  the  winds  of  Corto's  madness.  But  where  had  Corto
_been,_ those years?

Falling, burned and blinded, out of a Siberian sky.

"Case, this will be difficult for you to accept, I know that. You're an officer.
The training. I understand. But, Case, as God is my witness, we have been
betrayed."

Tears started from the blue eyes.

"Colonel, ah, who? Who's betrayed us?"

"General Girling, Case. You may know him by a code name. You do know
the man of whom I speak."

"Yeah,"  Case  said,  as  the  tears  continued  to  flow,  "I  guess  I  do.  Sir,"  he
added,  on  impulse.  "But,  sir,  Colonel,  what  exactly  should  we  do?  Now,  I
mean."

"Our duty at this point, Case, lies in flight. Escape. Evasion. We can make
the  Finnish  border,  nightfall  tomorrow.  Treetop  flying  on  manual.  Seat  of
the  pants,  boy.  But  that  will  only  be  the  beginning."  The  blue  eyes  slitted
above   tanned   cheekbones   slick   with   tears.   "Only   the   beginning.   Betrayal
from above. From _above...'_ He stepped back from the camera, dark stains
on  his  torn  twill  shirt.  Armitage's  face  had  been  masklike,  impassive,  but
Corto's    was    the    true    schizoid    mask,    illness    etched    deep    in    involuntary
muscle, distorting the expensive surgery.

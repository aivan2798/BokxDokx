even   sick,   I   just   wanted   it.   So   I   took   food   in   a   can,   mixed   it   real   wet,
because  I  didn't  have  another  can  for  water.  An'~  I  walked  all  day,  an'~  I
could see it, sometimes, city, an'~ it didn't seem too far. But it never got any
closer. An'~ then it _was_ gettin'~ closer, an'~ I saw what it was. Sometimes
that  day  it  had  looked  kinda  like  it  was  wrecked,  or  maybe  nobody  there,
an'~   other   times   I   thought   I'd   see   light   flashin'~   off   a   machine,   cars   or
somethin'~..." Her voice trailed off.

"What is it?"

"This thing," she gestured around at the fireplace, the dark walls, the dawn
outlining   the   doorway,   "where   we   live.   It   gets   _smaller,_   Case,   smaller,
closer you get to it."

Pausing one last time, by the doorway. "You ask your boy about that?"

"Yeah. He said I wouldn't understand, an'~ I was wastin'~ my time. Said it
was,  was  like...  an  _event._  An'~  it  was  our  horizon.  _Event  horizon,_  he
called it."

The words meant nothing to him. He left the bunker and struck out blindly,
heading -he knew, somehow -away from the sea. Now the hieroglyphs sped
across   the   sand,   fled   from   his   feet,   drew   back   from   him   as   he   walked.
"Hey," he said, "it's breaking down. Bet you know, too. What is it? Kuang?
Chinese icebreaker eating a hole in your heart? Maybe the Dixie Flatline's
no pushover, huh?"

He  heard  her  call  his  name.  Looked  back  and  she  was  following  him,  not
trying to catch up, the broken zip of the French fatigues flapping against the
brown of her belly, pubic hair framed in torn fabric. She looked like one of
the girls on the Finn's old magazines in Metro Holografix come to life, only
she    was    tired    and    sad    and    human,    the    ripped    costume    pathetic    as    she
stumbled over clumps of salt-silver sea grass.

And then, somehow, they stood in the surf, the three of them, and the boy's
gums   were   wide   and   bright   pink   against   his   thin   brown   face.   He   wore
ragged,  colorless  shorts,  limbs  too  thin  against  the  sliding  blue-gray  of  the
tide.

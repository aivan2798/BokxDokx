He turned and walked away, and after the seventh step, he'd closed his eyes,
watching  the  music  define  itself  at  the  center  of  things.  He  did  look  back,
once, although he didn't open his eyes.

He didn't need to.

They  were  there  by  the  edge  of  the  sea,  Linda  Lee  and  the  thin  child  who
said his name was Neuromancer. His leather jacket dangled from her hand,
catching the fringe of the surf.

He walked on, following the music.

Maelcum's Zion dub.

There    was    a    gray    place,    an    impression    of    fine    screens    shifting,    moire,
degrees  of  half  tone  generated  by  a  very  simple  graphics  program.  There
was a long hold on a view through chainlink, gulls frozen above dark water.
There were voices. There was a plain of black mirror, that tilted, and he was
quicksilver,  a  bead  of  mercury,  skittering  down,  striking  the  angles  of  an
invisible maze, fragmenting, flowing together, sliding again...

"Case? Mon?"

The music.

"You back, mon."

The music was taken from his ears.

"How long?" he heard himself ask, and knew that his mouth was very dry.

"Five minute, maybe. Too long. I wan'~ pull th'~ jack, Mute seh no. Screen
goin'~ funny, then Mute seh put th'~ phones on you."

He    opened    his    eyes.    Maelcum's    features    were    overlayed    with    bands    of
translucent hieroglyphs.

"An'~ you medicine," Maelcum said. "Two derm."

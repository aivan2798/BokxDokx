"Why?"

"Because I need you." The large yellow teeth appeared again. "And because
you need me."

"Bullshit.   Can   you   read   my   mind,   Finn?"   He   grimaced.   "Wintermute,   I
mean."

"Minds  aren't  _read._  See,  you've  still  got  the  paradigms  print  gave  you,
and you're barely print-literate. I can _access_ your memory, but that's not
the same as your mind." He reached into the exposed chassis of an ancient
television  and  withdrew  a  silver-black  vacuum  tube.  "See  this?  Part  of  my
DNA, sort of..." He tossed the thing into the shadows and Case heard it pop
and tinkle. "You're always building models. Stone circles. Cathedrals. Pipe-
organs. Adding machines. I got no idea why I'm here now, you know that?
But if the run goes off tonight, you'll have finally managed the real thing."

"I don't know what you're talking about."

"That's "you" in the collective. Your species."

"You killed those Turings."

The  Finn  shrugged.  "Hadda.  Hadda.  You  should  give  a  shit;  they  woulda
offed you and never thought twice. Anyway, why I got you here, we gotta
talk  more.  Remember  this?"  And  his  right  hand  held  the  charred  wasps'~
nest from Case's dream, reek of fuel in the closeness of the dark shop. Case
stumbled back against a wall of junk. "Yeah. That was me. Did it with the
holo    rig    in    the    window.    Another    memory    I    tapped    out    of    you    when    I
flatlined you that first time. Know why it's important?"

Case shook his head.

"Because" -and the nest, somehow, was gone -"it's the closest thing you got
to       what       Tessier-Ashpool       would       like       to       be.       The       human       equivalent.
Straylight's like that nest, or anyway it was supposed to work out that way. I
figure it'll make you feel better."

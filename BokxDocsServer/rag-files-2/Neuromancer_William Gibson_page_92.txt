years ago, and they never dust the goddam thing, 'cause it's an infidel relic."

Black  iron  deer  rusted  in  the  gardens  of  the  Seraglio.  Case  walked  beside
her,  watching  the  toes  of  her  boots  crunch  unkept  grass  made  stiff  by  an
early frost. They walked beside a path of cold octagonal flagstones. Winter
was waiting, somewhere in the Balkans.

"That Terzi, he's grade-A scum," she said. "He's the secret police. Torturer.
Real easy to buy out, too, with the kind of money Armitage was offering."
In the wet trees around them, birds began to sing.

"I did that job for you," Case said, "the one in London I got something, but I
don't know what it means." He told her the Corto story.

"Well,  I  knew  there  wasn't  anybody  name  of  Armitage  in  that  Screaming
Fist. Looked it up." She stroked the rusted flank of an iron doe. "You figure
the little computer pulled him out of it? In that French hospital?"

"I figure Wintermute," Case said.

She nodded.

"Thing is," he said, "do you think he knows he was Corto, before? I mean,
he   wasn't   anybody   in   particular,   by   the   time   he   hit   the   ward,   so   maybe
Wintermute just..."

"Yeah.  Built  him  up  from  go.  Yeah..."  She  turned  and  they  walked  on.  "It
figures. You know, the guy doesn't have any life going, in private. Not as far
as  I  can  tell.  You  see  a  guy  like  that,  you  figure  there's  something  he  does
when  he's  alone.  But  not  Armitage.  Sits  and  stares  at  the  wall,  man.  Then
something clicks and he goes into high gear and wheels for Wintermute."

"So why's he got that stash in London? Nostalgia?"

"Maybe  he  doesn't  know  about  it,"  she  said.  "Maybe  it's  just  in  his  name,
right?"

"I don't get it," Case said.

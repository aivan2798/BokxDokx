"No. You aren't that kind, man. I know that. You know something, Case? I
figure  you've  got  it  figured  out  that  it  was  me  told  Deane  to  off  that  little
cunt of yours in Chiba."

"Don't," Case said, taking an involuntary step toward the window.

"But  I  didn't.  What's  it  matter,  though?  How  much  does  it  really  matter  to
Mr.~ Case? Quit kidding yourself. I know your Linda, man. I know all the
Lindas.  Lindas  are  a  generic  product  in  my  line  of  work.  Know  why  she
decided to rip you off? Love. So you'd give a shit. Love? Wanna talk love?
She loved you. I know that. For the little she was worth, she loved you. You
couldn't handle it. She's dead."

Case's fist glanced off the glass.

"Don't fuck up the hands, man. Soon you punch deck."

Zone vanished, replaced by Freeside night and the lights of the condos. The
Braun shut off.

From the bed, the phone bleated steadily.

"Case?"  The  Flatline  was  waiting.  "Where  you  been?  I  got  it,  but  it  isn't
much."   The   construct   rattled   off   an   address.   "Place   had   some   weird   ice
around  it  for  a  nightclub.  That's  all  I  could  get  without  leaving  a  calling
card."

"Okay,"   Case   said.   "Tell   the   Hosaka   to   tell   Maelcum   to   disconnect   the
modem. Thanks, Dix."

"A pleasure."

He sat on the bed for a long time, savoring the new thing, the treasure.

Rage.

"Hey.    Lupus.    Hey,    Cath,    it's    friend    Lupus."    Bruce    stood    naked    in    his
doorway,    dripping    wet,    his    pupils    enormous.    "But    we're    just    having    a
shower. You wanna wait? Wanna shower?"

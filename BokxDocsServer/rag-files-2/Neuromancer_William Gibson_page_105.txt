"Pedestrian," Riviera sneered, and laughed, putting on a short-sleeved white
cotton shirt.

"Must be nice," Case said, getting up.

"Get high yourself, Case?"

"I hadda give it up."

"Freeside," Armitage said, touching the panel on the little Braun hologram
projector. The image shivered into focus, nearly three meters from tip to tip.
"Casinos   here."   He   reached   into   the   skeletal   representation   and   pointed.
"Hotels, strata-title property, big shops along here." His hand moved. "Blue
areas are lakes." He walked to one end of the model. "Big cigar. Narrows at
the ends."

"We can see that fine," Molly said.

"Mountain  effect,  as  it  narrows.  Ground  seems  to  get  higher,  more  rocky,
but  it's  an  easy  climb.  Higher  you  climb,  the  lower  the  gravity.  Sports  up
there. There's velodrome ring here." He pointed.

"A what?" Case leaned forward.

"They race bicycles," Molly said. "Low grav, high-traction tires, get up over
a hundred kilos an hour."

"This      end      doesn't      concern      us,"      Armitage      said      with      his      usual      utter
seriousness.

"Shit," Molly said, "I'm an avid cyclist."

Riviera giggled.

Armitage walked to the opposite end of the projection. "This end does." The
interior   detail   of   the   hologram   ended   here,   and   the   final   segment   of   the
spindle was empty. "This is the Villa Straylight. Steep climb out of gravity
and  every  approach  is  kinked.  There's  a  single  entrance,  here,  dead  center.
Zero gravity."

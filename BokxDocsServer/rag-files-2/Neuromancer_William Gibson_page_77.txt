fingered  the  slip  of  paper  Molly  had  given  him  and  made  his  way  up  the
stairs.

Molly was snoring on the temperfoam. A transparent cast ran from her knee
to a few millimeters below her crotch, the skin beneath the rigid micropore
mottled with bruises, the black shading into ugly yellow. Eight derms, each
a  different  size  and  color,  ran  in  a  neat  line  down  her  left  wrist.  An  Akai
transdermal unit lay beside her, its fine red leads connected to input trodes
under the cast.

He   turned   on   the   tensor   beside   the   Hosaka.   The   crisp   circle   of   light   fell
directly    on    the    Flatline's    construct.    He    slotted    some    ice,    connected    the
construct, and jacked in.

It was exactly the sensation of someone reading over his shoulder.

He coughed. "Dix? McCoy? That you man?" His throat was tight.

"Hey, bro," said a directionless voice.

"It's Case, man. Remember?"

"Miami, joeboy, quick study."

"What's the last thing you remember before I spoke to you, Dix?"

"Nothin'~."

"Hang   on."   He   disconnected   the   construct.   The   presence   was   gone.   He
reconnected it. "Dix? Who am I?"

"You got me hung, Jack. Who the fuck are you?"

"Ca -your buddy. Partner. What's happening, man?"

"Good question."

"Remember being here, a second ago?"

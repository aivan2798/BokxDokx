"Maelcum a rude boy," said the other, "an'~ a righteous tug pilot."

"But we have decided to send Aerol as well, in _Babylon Rocker,_ to watch
over _Garvey.'_

An awkward silence filled the dome.

"That's it?" Case asked. "You guys work for Armitage or what?"

"We   rent   you   space,"   said   the   Los   Angeles   Founder.   "We   have   a   certain
involvement   here   with   various   traffics,   and   no   regard   for   Babylon's   law.
Our    law    is    the    word    of    Jah.    But    this    time,    it    may    be,    we    have    been
mistaken."

"Measure twice, cut once," said the other, softly.

"Come  on,  Case,"  Molly  said.  "Let's  get  back  before  the  man  figures  out
we're gone."

"Maelcum will take you. Jah love, sister."

The    tug    _Marcus    Garvey,_    a    steel    drum    nine    meters    long    and    two    in
diameter,  creaked  and  shuddered  as  Maelcum  punched  for  a  navigational
burn.   Splayed   in   his   elastic   g-web,   Case   watched   the   Zionite's   muscular
back   through   a   haze   of   scopolamine.   He'd   taken   the   drug   to   blunt   SAS
nausea,   but   the   stimulants   the   manufacturer   included   to   counter   the   scop
had no effect on his doctored system.

"How long's it gonna take us to make Freeside?" Molly asked from her web
beside Maelcum's pilot module.

"Don be long now, m'seh dat."

"You guys ever think in hours?"

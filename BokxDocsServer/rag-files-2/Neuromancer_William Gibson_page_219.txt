"Hey," the construct said, "ol'~ Peter's totally apeshit, huh?"

They seemed to be part of the Tessier-Ashpool ice now; the emerald arches
had widened, grown together, become a solid mass. Green predominated in
the  planes  of  the  Chinese  program  that  surrounded  them.  "Gettin'~  close,
Dixie?"

"Real close. Need you soon."

"Listen, Dix. Wintermute says Kuang's set itself up solid in our Hosaka. I'm
going  to  have  to  jack  you  and  my  deck  out  of  the  circuit,  haul  you  into
Straylight,      and      plug      you      back      in,      into      the      custodial      program      there,
Wintermute says. Says the Kuang virus will be all through there. Then we
run from inside, through the Straylight net."

Into her darkness, a churning synaesthesia, where her pain was the taste of
old   iron,   scent   of   melon,   wings   of   a   moth   brushing   her   cheek.   She   was
unconscious,   and   he   was   barred   from   her   dreams.   When   the   optic   chip
flared,  the  alphanumerics  were  haloed,  each  one  ringed  with  a  faint  pink
aura.

"I'm very unhappy with this, Peter." 3Jane's voice seemed to arrive from a
hollow distance. Molly could hear, he realized, then corrected himself. The
simstim unit was intact and still in place; he could feel it digging against her
ribs.    Her    ears    registered    the    vibrations    of    the    girl's    voice.    Riviera    said
something   brief   and   indistinct.   "But   I   don't,"   she   said,   "and   it   isn't   fun.
Hideo will bring a medical unit down from intensive care, but this needs a
surgeon."

There  was  a  silence.  Very  distinctly,  Case  heard  the  water  lap  against  the
side of the pool.

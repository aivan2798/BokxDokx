He jacked in.

"Dixie?"

"Yeah."

"You ever try to crack an AI?"

"Sure. I flatlined. First time. I was larkin'~, jacked up real high, out by Rio
heavy  commerce  sector.  Big  biz,  multinationals,  Government  of  Brazil  lit
up like a Christmas tree. Just larkin'~ around, you know? And then I started
picking up on this one cube, maybe three levels higher up. Jacked up there
and made a pass."

"What did it look like, the visual?"

"White cube."

"How'd you know it was an AI?"

"How'd I know? Jesus. It was the densest ice I'd ever seen. So what else was
it? The military down there don't have anything like that. Anyway, I jacked
out and told my computer to look it up."

"Yeah?"

"It      was      on      the      Turing      Registry.      AI.      Frog      company      owned      its      Rio
mainframe."

Case chewed his lower lip and gazed out across the plateaus of the Eastern
Seaboard   Fission   Authority,   into   the   infinite   neuroelectronic   void   of   the
matrix. "Tessier-Ashpool, Dixie?"

"Tessier, yeah."

"And you went back?"

"Sure. I was crazy. Figured I'd try to cut it. Hit the first strata and that's all
she wrote. My joeboy smelled the skin frying and pulled the trodes off me.

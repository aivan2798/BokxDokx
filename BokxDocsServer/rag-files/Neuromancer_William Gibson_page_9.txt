"Not if I remember to take my pills," he said, as a tangible wave of longing
hit him, lust and loneliness riding in on the wavelength of amphetamine. He
remembered  the  smell  of  her  skin  in  the  overheated  darkness  of  a  coffin
near the port, her fingers locked across the small of his back.

All the meat, he thought, and all it wants.

"Wage," she said, narrowing her eyes. "He wants to see you with a hole in
your face." She lit her own cigarette.

"Who says? Ratz? You been talking to Ratz?"

"No. Mona. Her new squeeze is one of Wage's boys."

"I  don't  owe  him  enough.  He  does  me,  he's  out  the  money  anyway."  He
shrugged.

"Too many people owe him now, Case. Maybe you get to be the example.
You seriously better watch it."

"Sure. How about you, Linda? You got anywhere to sleep?"

"Sleep." She shook her head. "Sure, Case." She shivered, hunched forward
over the table. Her face was filmed with sweat.

"Here," he said, and dug in the pocket of his windbreaker, coming up with a
crumpled  fifty.  He  smoothed  it  automatically,  under  the  table,  folded  it  in
quarters, and passed it to her.

"You need that, honey. You better give it to Wage." There was something in
the  gray  eyes  now  that  he  couldn't  read,  something  he'd  never  seen  there
before.

"I owe Wage a lot more than that. Take it. I got more coming," he lied, as he
watched his New Yen vanish into a zippered pocket.

"You get your money, Case, you find Wage quick."

"I'll see you, Linda," he said, getting up.

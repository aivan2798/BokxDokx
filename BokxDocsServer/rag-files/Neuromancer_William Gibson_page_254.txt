"Take it," Case said. "You're faster."

"Now your best _de_-fense, boy, it's a good _off_-fense."

And  the  Flatline  aligned  the  nose  of  Kuang's  sting  with  the  center  of  the
dark below. And dove.

Case's sensory input warped with their velocity.

His mouth filled with an aching taste of blue.

His  eyes  were  eggs  of  unstable  crystal,  vibrating  with  a  frequency  whose
name   was   rain   and   the   sound   of   trains,   suddenly   sprouting   a   humming
forest    of    hair-fine    glass    spines.    The    spines    split,    bisected,    split    again,
exponential growth under the dome of the Tessier-Ashpool ice.

The  roof  of  his  mouth  cleaved  painlessly,  admitting  rootlets  that  whipped
around his tongue, hungry for the taste of blue, to feed the crystal forests of
his   eyes,   forests   that   pressed   against   the   green   dome,   pressed   and   were
hindered, and spread, growing down, filling the universe of T-A, down into
the    waiting,    hapless    suburbs    of    the    city    that    was    the    mind    of    Tessier
Ashpool S.A.

And    he    was    remembering    an    ancient    story,    a    king    placing    coins    on    a
chessboard, doubling the amount at each square...

Exponential...

Darkness fell in from every side, a sphere of singing black, pressure on the
extended crystal nerves of the universe of data he had nearly become...

And  when  he  was  nothing,  compressed  at  the  heart  of  all  that  dark,  there
came a point where the dark could be no _more,_ and something tore.

The   Kuang   program   spurted   from   tarnished   cloud,   Case's   consciousness
divided  like  beads  of  mercury  arcing  above  an  endless  beach  the  color  of
the  dark  silver  clouds.  His  vision  was  spherical,  as  though  a  single  retina
lined the inner surface of a globe that contained all things, if all things could
be counted.

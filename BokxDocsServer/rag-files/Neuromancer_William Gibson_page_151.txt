"Gangster."

He  opened  his  eyes.  Cath  stood  beside  him  in  a  black  shift,  her  hair  still
wild from the ride in the Honda.

"Thought you went home," he said, and covered his confusion with a sip of
Carlsberg.

"I got him to drop me off at this shop. Bought this." She ran her palm across
the  fabric,  curve  of  the  pelvic  girdle.  He  saw  the  blue  derm  on  her  wrist.
"Like it?"

"Sure." He automatically scanned the faces around them, then looked back
at her. "What do you think you're up to, honey?"

"You    like    the    beta    you    got    off    us,    Lupus?"    She    was    very    close    now,
radiating  heat  and  tension,  eyes  slitted  over  enormous  pupils  and  a  tendon
in   her   neck   tense   as   a   bowstring.   She   was   quivering,   vibrating   invisibly
with the fresh buzz. "You get off?"

"Yeah. But the comedown's a bitch."

"Then you need another one."

"And what's that supposed to lead to?"

"I got a key. Up the hill behind the Paradise, just the creamiest crib. People
down the well on business tonight, if you follow me..."

"If I follow you."

She took his hand between hers, her palms hot and dry. "You're Yak, aren't
you, Lupus? Gaijin soldierman for the Yakuza."

"You got an eye, huh?" He withdrew his hand and fumbled for a cigarette.

"How  come  you  got  all  your  fingers,  then?  I  thought  you  had  to  chop  one
off every time you screwed up."

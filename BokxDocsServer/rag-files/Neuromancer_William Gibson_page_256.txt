"Wintermute?"

"No. I saw her death coming. In the patterns you sometimes imagined you
could detect in the dance of the street. Those patterns are real. I am complex
enough,      in      my      narrow      ways,      to      read      those      dances.      Far      better      than
Wintermute can. I saw her death in her need for you, in the magnetic code
of   the   lock   on   the   door   of   your   coffin   in   Cheap   Hotel,   in   Julie   Deane's
account  with  a  Hongkong  shirtmaker.  As  clear  to  me  as  the  shadow  of  a
tumor to a surgeon studying a patient's scan. When she took your Hitachi to
her boy, to try to access it -she had no idea what it carried, still less how she
might  sell  it,  and  her  deepest  wish  was  that  you  would  pursue  and  punish
her   -I   intervened.   My   methods   are   far   more   subtle   than   Wintermute's.   I
brought her here. Into myself."

"Why?"

"Hoping I could bring you here as well, keep you here. But I failed."

"So what now?" He swung them back into the bank of cloud. "Where do we
go from here?"

"I    don't    know,    Case.    Tonight    the    very    matrix    asks    itself    that    question.
Because  you  have  won.  You  have  already  won,  don't  you  see?  You  won
when   you   walked   away   from   her   on   the   beach.   She   was   my   last   line   of
defense. I die soon, in one sense. As does Wintermute. As surely as Riviera
does, now, as he lies paralyzed beside the stump of a wall in the apartments
of    my    Lady    3Jane    Marie-France,    his    _nigra-striatal_    system    unable    to
produce  the  dopamine  receptors  that  could  save  him  from  Hideo's  arrow.
But Riviera will survive only as these eyes, if I am allowed to keep them."

"There's  the  _word,_  right?  The  code.  So  how've  I  _won?_  I've  won  jack
shit."

"Flip now."

"Where's Dixie? What have you done with the Flatline?"

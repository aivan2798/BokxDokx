sector, looks to me. That's king hell ice, Case, black as the grave and slick
as  glass.  Fry  your  brain  soon  as  look  at  you.  We  get  any  closer  now,  it'll
have  tracers  up  our  ass  and  out  both  ears,  be  tellin'~  the  boys  in  the  T-A
boardroom the size of your shoes and how long your dick is."

"This isn't looking so hot, is it? I mean, the Turings are on it. I was thinking
maybe we should try to bail out. I can take you."

"Yeah? No shit? You don't wanna see what that Chinese program can do?"

"Well,  I..."  Case  stared  at  the  green  walls  of  the  T-A  ice.  "Well,  screw  it.
Yeah. We run."

"Slot it."

"Hey, Maelcum," Case said, jacking out, "I'm probably gonna be under the
trodes  for  maybe  eight  hours  straight."  Maelcum  was  smoking  again.  The
cabin was swimming in smoke. "So I can't get to the head..."

"No  problem,  mon."  The  Zionite  executed  a  high  forward  somersault  and
rummaged through the contents of a zippered mesh bag, coming up with a
coil of transparent tubing and something else, something sealed in a sterile
bubble pack.

He called it a Texas catheter, and Case didn't like it at all.

He slotted the Chinese virus, paused, then drove it home.

"Okay," he said, "we're on. Listen, Maelcum, if it gets really funny, you can
grab  my  left  wrist.  I'll  feel  it.  Otherwise,  I  guess  you  do  what  the  Hosaka
tells you, okay?"

"Sure, mon." Maelcum lit a fresh joint.

"And     turn     the     scrubber     up.     I     don't     want     that     shit     tangling     with     my
neurotransmitters. I got a bad hangover as it is."

Maelcum grinned.

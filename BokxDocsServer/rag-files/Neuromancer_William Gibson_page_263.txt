"So   what's   the   score?   How   are   things   different?   You   running   the   world

"Things aren't different. Things are things."

"But what do you do? You just _there?'_ Case shrugged, put the vodka and
the shuriken down on the cabinet and lit a Yeheyuan.

"I talk to my own kind."

"But you're the whole thing. Talk to yourself?"

period  of  eight  years,  in  the  nineteen-seventies.  'Til  there  was  me,  natch,
there was nobody to know, nobody to answer."

"From where?"

"Centauri system."

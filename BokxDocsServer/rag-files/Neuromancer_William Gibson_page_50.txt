burnout  belt,  and  trade  a  program  for  the  operation  that'll  fix  him  up.  We
coulda  bought  twenty  world  class  cowboys  for  what  the  market  was  ready
to pay for that surgical program. You were good, but not _that_ good..." She
scratched the side of her nose.

"Obviously makes sense to somebody," he said. "Somebody big."

"Don't let me hurt your feelings." She grinned. "We're gonna be pulling one
hardcore   run,   Case,   just   to   get   the   Flatline's   construct.   Sense/Net   has   it
locked   in   a   library   vault   uptown.   Tighter   than   an   eel's   ass,   Case.   Now,
Sense/Net, they got all their new material for the fall season locked in there
too.   Steal   that   and   we'd   be   richer   than   shit.   But   no,   we   gotta   get   us   the
Flatline and nothing else. Weird."

"Yeah,  it's  all  weird.  You're  weird,  this  hole's  weird,  and  who's  the  weird
little gopher outside in the hall?"

"Finn's  an  old  connection  of  mine.  Fence,  mostly.  Software.  This  privacy
biz is a sideline. But I got Armitage to let him be our tech here, so when he
shows up later, you never saw him. Got it?"

"So what's Armitage got dissolving inside you?"

"I'm an easy make." She smiled. "Anybody any good at what they do, that's
what they _are,_ right? You gotta jack, I gotta tussle."

He stared at her. "So tell me what you know about Armitage."

"For  starters,  nobody  named  Armitage  took  part  in  any  Screaming  Fist.  I
checked. But that doesn't mean much. He doesn't look like any of the pics
of the guys who got out." She shrugged. "Big deal. And starters is all I got."
She drummed her nails on the back of the chair. "But you _are_ a cowboy,
aren't you? I mean, maybe you could have a little look around." She smiled.

"He'd kill me."

"Maybe.   Maybe   not.   I   think   he   needs   you,   Case,   and   real   bad.   Besides,
you're a clever john, no? You can winkle him, sure."

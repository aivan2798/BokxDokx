"You betcha. Very discreet. He's got half that rack, full clinic. Does repairs
for samurai." She was zipping her bag. "You ever been to 'Stambul?"

"Couple days, once."

"Never changes," she said. "Bad old town."

"It  was  like  this  when  we  headed  for  Chiba,"  Molly  said,  staring  out  the
train  window  at  blasted  industrial  moonscape,  red  beacons  on  the  horizon
warning  aircraft  away  from  a  fusion  plant.  "We  were  in  L.A.  He  came  in
and  said  Pack,  we  were  booked  for  Macau.  When  we  got  there,  I  played
fantan  in  the  Lisboa  and  he  crossed  over  into  Zhongshan.  Next  day  I  was
playing ghost with you in Night City." She took a silk scarf from the sleeve
of  her  black  jacket  and  polished  the  insets.  The  landscape  of  the  northern
Sprawl woke confused memories of childhood for Case, dead grass tufting
the cracks in a canted slab of freeway concrete.

The train began to decelerate ten kilometers from the airport. Case watched
the  sun  rise  on  the  landscape  of  childhood,  on  broken  slag  and  the  rusting
shells of refineries.

It was raining in Beyoglu, and the rented Mercedes slid past the grilled and
unlit   windows   of   cautious   Greek   and   Armenian   jewelers.   The   street   was
almost  empty,  only  a  few  dark-coated  figures  on  the  sidewalks  turning  to
stare after the car.

"This was formerly the prosperous European section of Ottoman Istanbul,"
purred the Mercedes.

"So it's gone downhill," Case said.

"The Hilton's in Cumhuriyet Caddesi," Molly said. She settled back against
the car's gray ultrasuede.

"How come Armitage flies alone?" Case asked. He had a headache.

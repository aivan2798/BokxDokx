black jacket. "Five. Five minutes. By your clock, okay?"

"Not what I'm paid for."

"What    you're    paid    for    is    one    thing.    Me    letting    some    tight    friends    die
because you're too literal about your instructions is something else."

"Bullshit.  Tight  friends  my  ass.  You're  going  in  there  to  check  us  out  with
your  smuggler."  She  put  a  booted  foot  up  on  the  dust-covered  Kandinsky
coffee table.

"Ah, Case, sport, it does look as though your companion there is definitely
armed, aside from having a fair amount of silicon in her head. What is this
about,  exactly?"  Deane's  ghostly  cough  seemed  to  hang  in  the  air  between
them.

"Hold on, Julie. Anyway, I'll be coming in alone."

"You can be sure of that, old son. Wouldn't have it any other way."

"Okay,"  she  said.  "Go.  But  five  minutes.  Any  more  and  I'll  come  in  and
cool your tight friend permanently. And while you're at it, you try to figure
something out."

"What's that?"

"Why I'm doing you the favor." She turned and walked out, past the stacked
white modules of preserved ginger.

"Keeping stranger company than usual, Case?" asked Julie.

"Julie, she's gone. You wanna let me in? Please, Julie?"

The bolts worked. "Slowly, Case," said the voice.

"Turn  on  the  works,  Julie,  all  the  stuff  in  the  desk,"  Case  said,  taking  his
place in the swivel chair.

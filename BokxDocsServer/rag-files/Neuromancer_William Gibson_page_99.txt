Peter Riviera smiled sweetly, closed his eyes, and fell instantly asleep.

Molly turned away, her lenses reflected in the dark window.

"You been up, haven't you?" Molly asked, as he squirmed his way back into
the deep temperfoam couch on the _JAL_ shuttle.

"Nah. Never travel much, just for biz." The steward was attaching readout
trodes to his wrist and left ear.

"Hope you don't get SAS," she said.

"Airsick? No way."

"It's not the same. Your heartbeat'll speed up in zero-g, and your inner ear'll
go nuts for a while. Kicks in your flight reflex, like you'll be getting signals
to run like hell, and a lot of adrenaline." The steward moved on to Riviera,
taking a new set of trodes from his red plastic apron.

Case   turned   his   head   and   tried   to   make   out   the   outline   of   the   old   Orly
terminals,  but  the  shuttle  pad  was  screened  by  graceful  blast-deflectors  of
wet   concrete.   The   one   nearest   the   window   bore   an   Arabic   slogan   in   red
spraybomb.

He closed his eyes and told himself the shuttle was only a big airplane, one
that    flew    very    high.    It    smelled    like    an    airplane,    like    new    clothes    and
chewing   gum   and   exhaustion.   He   listened   to   the   piped   koto   music   and
waited.

Twenty minutes, then gravity came down on him like a great soft hand with
bones of ancient stone.

Space    adaptation    syndrome    was    worse    than    Molly's    description,    but    it
passed quickly enough and he was able to sleep. The steward woke him as
they were preparing to dock at _JAL_'s terminal cluster.

"We    transfer    to    Freeside    now?"    he    asked,    eyeing    a    shred    of    Yeheyuan
tobacco  that  had  drifted  gracefully  up  out  of  his  shirt  pocket  to  dance  ten
centimeters from his nose. There was no smoking on shuttle flights.

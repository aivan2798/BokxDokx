Armitage wore a dark suit, too formal for the place, and a white silk shirt.
His gold bracelet rattled as he raised his wine and sipped. "I've ordered for
you," he said.

Molly  and  Armitage  ate  in  silence,  while  Case  sawed  shakily  at  his  steak,
reducing it to uneaten bite-sized fragments, which he pushed around in the
rich sauce, finally abandoning the whole thing.

"Jesus," Molly said, her own plate empty, "gimme that. You know what this
costs?"  She  took  his  plate.  "They  gotta  raise  a  whole  animal  for  years  and
then they kill it. This isn't vat stuff." She forked a mouthful up and chewed.

"What's happening?" Case asked Armitage, who said nothing.

Molly picked her teeth with a burgundy nail.

"Good  evening,"  Riviera  said,  stepping  forward  on  a  small  stage  at  the  far
end   of   the   room.   Case   blinked.   In   his   discomfort,   he   hadn't   noticed   the

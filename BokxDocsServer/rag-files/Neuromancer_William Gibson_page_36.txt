"It's   on   all   the   time,"   Deane   said   mildly,   taking   a   gun   from   behind   the
exposed  works  of  his  old  mechanical  typewriter  and  aiming  it  carefully  at
Case. It was a belly gun, a magnum revolver with the barrel sawn down to a
nub. The front of the trigger guard had been cut away and the grips wrapped
with what looked like old masking tape. Case thought it looked very strange
in Dean's manicured pink hands. "Just taking care, you understand. Nothing
personal. Now tell me what you want."

"I need a history lesson, Julie. And a go-to on somebody."

"What's    moving,    old    son?"    Deane's    shirt    was    candy-striped    cotton,    the
collar white and rigid, like porcelain.

lap terminal. "It seems as though you know as much as my net does, Case.
This  gentleman  seems  to  have  a  temporary  arrangement  with  the  Yakuza,
and the sons of the neon chrysanthemum have ways of screening their allies

Case. "What sort of history?"

"The war. You in the war, Julie?"

"The war? What's there to know? Lasted three weeks."

"Screaming Fist."

"Famous.  Don't  they  teach  you  history  these  days?  Great  bloody  postwar
political   football,   that   was.   Watergated   all   to   hell   and   back.   Your   brass,
Case, your Sprawlside brass in, where was it, McLean? In the bunkers, all
of that... great scandal. Wasted a fair bit of patriotic young flesh in order to
test   some   new   technology.   They   knew   about   the   Russians'~   defenses,   it

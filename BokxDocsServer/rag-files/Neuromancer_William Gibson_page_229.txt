The  deck  and  the  construct  kept  pressing  the  shuriken  in  his  jacket  pocket
into his hip.

"You got a watch?" he asked Maelcum.

The Zionite shook his locks. "Time be time."

"Jesus," Case said, and closed his eyes.

The   Braun   scuttled   over   mounded   carpets   and   tapped   one   of   its   padded
claws against an oversized rectangular door of dark battered wood. Behind
them,   the   cart   sizzled   and   shot   blue   sparks   from   a   louvered   panel.   The
sparks struck the carpet beneath the cart and Case smelled scorched wool.

"This  th'~  way,  mon?"  Maelcum  eyed  the  door  and  snapped  the  shotgun's
safety.

"Hey,"  Case  said,  more  to  himself  than  to  Maelcum,  "you  think  I  know?"
The Braun rotated its spherical body and the LED strobed.

"It wan'~ you open door," Maelcum said, nodding.

Case  stepped  forward  and  tried  the  ornate  brass  knob.  There  was  a  brass

plaintively    as    he    edged    it    open,    Maelcum    stepping    past    him    with    the
Remington thrust forward from his hip.

"Books," Maelcum said.

The library, the white steel shelves with their labels.

"I  know  where  we  are,"  Case  said.  He  looked  back  at  the  service  cart.  A
curl   of   smoke   was   rising   from   the   carpet.   "So   come   on,"   he   said.   "Cart.

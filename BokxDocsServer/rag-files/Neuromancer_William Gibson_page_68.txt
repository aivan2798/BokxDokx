Armitage crossed stiffly to the table and took three fat bundles of New Yen
from    the    pockets    of    his    trenchcoat.    "You    want    to    count    it?"    he    asked
Yonderboy.

"No," the Panther Modern said. "You'll pay. You're a Mr.~ Who. You pay to
stay one. Not a Mr.~ Name."

"I hope that isn't a threat," Armitage said.

"That's business," said Yonderboy, stuffing the money into the single pocket
on the front of his suit.

The phone rang. Case answered.

"Molly," he told Armitage, handing him the phone.

The Sprawl's geodesics were lightening into predawn gray as Case left the
building.  His  limbs  felt  cold  and  disconnected.  He  couldn't  sleep.  He  was
sick of the loft. Lupus had gone, then Armitage, and Molly was in surgery
somewhere.     Vibration     beneath     his     feet     as     a     train     hissed     past.     Sirens
dopplered in the distance.

He took corners at random, his collar up, hunched in a new leather jacket,
flicking    the    first    of    a    chain    of    Yeheyuans    into    the    gutter    and    lighting
another.     He     tried     to     imagine     Armitage's     toxin     sacs     dissolving     in     his
bloodstream,    microscopic    membranes    wearing    thinner    as    he    walked,    it
didn't  seem  real.  Neither  did  the  fear  and  agony  he'd  seen  through  Molly's
eyes  in  the  lobby  of  Sense/Net.  He  found  himself  trying  to  remember  the
faces  of  the  three  people  he'd  killed  in  Chiba.  The  men  were  blanks;  the
woman reminded him of Linda Lee. A battered tricycle-truck with mirrored
windows bounced past him, empty plastic cylinders rattling in its bed.

"Case."

He darted sideways, instinctively getting a wall behind his back.

"Message    for    you,    Case."    Lupus    Yonderboy's    suit    cycled    through    pure
primaries. "Pardon. Not to startle you."

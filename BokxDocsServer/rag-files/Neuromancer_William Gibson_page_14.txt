"Be seeing you, Julie. I'll say hello to Wage."

Deane's fingers came up to brush the perfect knot in his pale silk tie.

He    was    less    than    a    block    from    Deane's    office    when    it    hit,    the    sudden
cellular awareness that someone was on his ass, and very close.

The   cultivation   of   a   certain   tame   paranoia   was   something   Case   took   for
granted.  The  trick  lay  in  not  letting  it  get  out  of  control.  But  that  could  be
quite a trick, behind a stack of octagons. He fought the adrenaline surge and
composed his narrow features in a mask of bored vacancy, pretending to let
the  crowd  carry  him  along.  When  he  saw  a  darkened  display  window,  he
managed   to   pause   by   it.   The   place   was   a   surgical   boutique,   closed   for
renovations.  With  his  hands  in  the  pockets  of  his  jacket,  he  stared  through
the glass at a flat lozenge of vatgrown flesh that lay on a carved pedestal of
imitation jade. The color of its skin reminded him of Zone's whores; it was
tattooed with a luminous digital display wired to a subcutaneous chip. Why
bother   with   the   surgery,   he   found   himself   thinking,   while   sweat   coursed
down his ribs, when you could just carry the thing around in your pocket?

Without  moving  his  head,  he  raised  his  eyes  and  studied  the  reflection  of
the passing crowd.

There.

Behind   sailors   in   short-sleeved   khaki.   Dark   hair,   mirrored   glasses,   dark
clothing, slender...

And gone.

Then Case was running, bent low, dodging between bodies.

"Rent me a gun, Shin?"

The boy smiled. "Two hour." They stood together in the smell of fresh raw
seafood at the rear of a Shiga sushi stall. "You come back, two hour."

"I need one now, man. Got anything right now?"

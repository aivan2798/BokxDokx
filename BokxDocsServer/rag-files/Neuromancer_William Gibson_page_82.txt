schizophrenic.      He      became      catatonic      and      was      sent      to      a      government
institution      on      the      outskirts      of      Toulon.      He      became      a      subject      in      an
experimental    program    that    sought    to    reverse    schizophrenia    through    the
application    of    cybernetic    models.    A    random    selection    of    patients    were
provided with microcomputers and encouraged, with help from students, to
program them. He was cured, the only success in the entire experiment.

The record ended there.

Case turned on the foam and Molly cursed him softly for disturbing her.

The telephone rang. He pulled it into bed. "Yeah?"

"We're going to Istanbul," Armitage said. "Tonight."

"What does the bastard want?" Molly asked.

"Says we're going to Istanbul tonight."

"That's just wonderful."

Armitage was reading off flight numbers and departure times.

Molly sat up and turned on the light.

"What about my gear?" Case asked. "My deck."

"Finn will handle it," said Armitage, and hung up.

Case  watched  her  pack.  There  were  dark  circles  under  her  eyes,  but  even
with   the   cast   on,   it   was   like   watching   a   dance.   No   wasted   motion.   His
clothes were a rumpled pile beside his bag.

"You hurting?" he asked.

"I could do with another night at Chin's."

"Your dentist?"

arteries.    He    saw    Molly    hauling    herself    up    the    endless    steel    rungs.    He
opened his eyes.

"I dunno, man," he said, a strange taste in his mouth. He looked down at his
desk, at his hands. "I don't know." He looked back up. The brown face was
calm now, intent. Maelcum's chin was hidden by the high helmet ring of his
old   blue   suit.   "She's   inside,"   he   said.   "Molly's   inside.   In   Straylight,   it's
called.   If   there's   any   Babylon,   man,   that's   it.   We   leave   on   her,   she   ain't
comin'~ out, Steppin'~ Razor or not."

Maelcum nodded, the dreadbag bobbing behind him like a captive balloon
of crocheted cotton. "She you woman, Case?"

"I   dunno.   Nobody's   woman,   maybe."   He   shrugged.   And   found   his   anger

speakers. "Maelcum not runnin'~, no. I talk wi'~ Aerol, he certain t'~ see it
in similar light."

Case stared. "I don't understand you guys at all," he said.

"Don'~   'stan'~   you,   mon,"   the   Zionite   said,   nodding   to   the   beat,   "but   we
mus'~ move by Jah love, each one."

Case jacked in and flipped for the matrix.

"Get my wire?"

"Yeah."   He   saw   that   the   Chinese   program   had   grown,   delicate   arches   of
shifting polychrome were nearing the T-A ice.

"Well, it's gettin'~ stickier," the Flatline said. "Your boss wiped the bank on
that     other     Hosaka,     and     damn     near     took     ours     with     it.     But     your     pal

and  hallucinations  were  gone  now,  and  the  thing  looked  real  as  _Marcus
Garvey,_ a wingless antique jet, its smooth skin plated with black chrome.

"Right on," the Flatline said.

"Right," Case said, and flipped.

"-like   that.   I'm   sorry,"   3Jane   was   saying,   as   she   bandaged   Molly's   head.
"Our unit says no concussion, no permanent damage to the eye. You didn't
know him very well, before you came here?"

"Didn't know him at all," Molly said bleakly. She was on her back on a high
bed   or   padded   table.   Case   couldn't   feel   the   injured   leg.   The   synaesthetic
effect of the original injection seemed to have worn off. The, black ball was
gone, but her hands were immobilized by soft straps she couldn't see.

"He wants to kill you."

"Figures,"   Molly   said,   staring   up   at   the   rough   ceiling   past   a   very   bright
light.

"I  don't  think  I  want  him  to,"  3Jane  said,  and  Molly  painfully  turned  her
head to look up into the dark eyes.

"Don't play with me," she said.

"But   I   think   I   might   like   to,"   3Jane   said,   and   bent   to   kiss   her   forehead,
brushing  the  hair  back  with  a  warm  hand.  There  were  smears  of  blood  on
her pale djellaba.

"Where's he gone now?" Molly asked.

"Another  injection,  probably,"  3Jane  said,  straightening  up.  "He  was  quite
impatient   for   your   arrival.   I   think   it   might   be   fun   to   nurse   you   back   to
health,  Molly."  She  smiled,  absently  wiping  a  bloody  hand  down  the  front
of the robe. "Your leg will need to be reset, but we can arrange that."

"What about Peter?"

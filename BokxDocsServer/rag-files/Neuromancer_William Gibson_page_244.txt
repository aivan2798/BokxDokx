Maelcum   halted,   turned,   glowering   at   him,   the   Remington   in   his   hands.
"Right, mon? How's right?"

"Got Molly in there, but she's out of it. Riviera, he can throw holos. Maybe
he's  got  Molly's  fletcher."  Maelcum  nodded.  "And  there's  a  ninja,  a  family
bodyguard."

Maelcum's    frown    deepened.    "You    listen,    Babylon    mon,"    he    said.    "I    a
warrior.   But   this   no   m'~   fight,   no   Zion   fight   Babylon   fightin'~   Babylon,
eatin'~  i'self,  ya  know?  But  Jah  seh  I  an'~  I  t'~  bring  Steppin'~  Razor  outa
this."

Case blinked.

"She a warrior," Maelcum said, as if it explained everything. "Now you tell
me, mon, who I _not_ t'~ kill."

"3Jane," he said, after a pause. "A girl there. Has a kinda white robe thing
on, with a hood. We need her."

When they reached the entrance, Maelcum walked straight in, and Case had
no choice but to follow him.

3Jane's   country   was   deserted,   the   pool   empty.   Maelcum   handed   him   the
deck   and   the   construct   and   walked   to   the   edge   of   the   pool.   Beyond   the
white pool furniture, there was darkness, shadows of the ragged, waist-high
maze of partially demolished walls.

The water lapped patiently against the side of the pool.

"They're here," Case said. "They gotta be."

Maelcum nodded.

The first arrow pierced his upper arm. The Remington roared, its meter of
muzzle-flash  blue  in  the  light  from  the  pool.  The  second  arrow  struck  the
shotgun itself, sending it spinning across the white tiles. Maelcum sat down
hard and fumbled at the black thing that protruded from his arm. He yanked
at it.

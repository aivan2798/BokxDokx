"What bothers me is, nothin'~ does."

"How's that?"

"Had  me  this  buddy  in  the  Russian  camp,  Siberia,  his  thumb  was  frostbit.
Medics   came   by   and   they   cut   it   off.   Month   later   he's   tossin'~   all   night.
Elroy,  I  said,  what's  eatin'~  you?  Goddam  thumb's  itchin'~,  he  says.  So  I
told him, scratch it. McCoy, he says, it's the _other_ goddam thumb." When
the construct laughed, it came through as something else, not laughter, but a
stab of cold down Case's spine. "Do me a favor, boy."

"What's that, Dix?"

"This scam of yours, when it's over, you erase this goddam thing."

Case didn't understand the Zionites.

Aerol, with no particular provocation, related the tale of the baby who had
burst  from  his  forehead  and  scampered  into  a  forest  of  hydroponic  ganja.
"Ver'~ small baby, mon, no long'~ you finga." He rubbed his palm across an
unscarred expanse of brown forehead and smiled.

"It's the ganja," Molly said, when Case told her the story. "They don't make
much     of     a     difference     between     states,     you     know?     Aerol     tells     you     it
happened, well, it happened to _him._ It's not like bullshit, more like poetry.
Get it?"

Case  nodded  dubiously.  The  Zionites  always  touched  you  when  they  were
talking, hands on your shoulder. He didn't like that.

"Hey, Aerol," Case called, an hour later, as he prepared for a practice run in
the   freefall   corridor.   "Come   here,   man.   Wanna   show   you   this   thing."   He
held out the trodes.

Aerol  executed  a  slow-motion  tumble.  His  bare  feet  struck  the  steel  wall
and   he   caught   a   girder   with   his   free   hand.   The   other   held   a   transparent
waterbag bulging with blue-green algae. He blinked mildly and grinned.

"Try it," Case said.

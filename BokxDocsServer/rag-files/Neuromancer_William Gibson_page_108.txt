"Voices." The Founder from Los Angeles was staring at Case. "We monitor
many   frequencies.   We   listen   always.   Came   a   voice,   out   of   the   babel   of
tongues, speaking to us. It played us a mighty dub."

"Call 'em Winter Mute," said the other, making it two words.

Case felt the skin crawl on his arms.

"The  Mute  talked  to  us,"  the  first  Founder  said.  "The  Mute  said  we  are  to
help you."

"When was this?" Case asked.

"Thirty hours prior you dockin'~ Zion."

"You ever hear this voice before?"

"No," said the man from Los Angeles, "and we are uncertain of its meaning.
If these are Final Days, we must expect false prophets..."

"Listen,"   Case   said,   "that's   an   AI,   you   know?   Artificial   intelligence.   The
music   it   played   you,   it   probably   just   tapped   your   banks   and   cooked   up
whatever it thought you'd like to --"

"Babylon,"   broke   in   the   other   Founder,   "mothers   many   demon,   I   an'~   I
know. Multitude horde!"

"What was that you called me, old man?" Molly asked.

"Steppin'~    Razor.    An'~    you    bring    a    scourge    on    Babylon,    sister,    on    its
darkest heart..."

"What kinda message the voice have?" Case asked.

"We were told to help you," the other said, "that you might serve as a tool of
Final Days." His lined face was troubled. "We were told to send Maelcum
with you, in his tug _Garvey_ to the Babylon port of Freeside. And this we
shall do."

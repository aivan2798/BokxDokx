"C'mon,  sister.  We're  for  out."  The  eyes  of  the  two  Moderns  stared  out  of
madly swirling shades of polycarbon, their suits unable to keep up with the
confusion  of  shape  and  color  that  raged  behind  them.  "You  hurt?  C'mon.
Tommy'll  walk  you."  Tommy  handed  something  to  the  one  who  spoke,  a
video camera wrapped in polycarbon.

"Chicago," she said, "I'm on my way." And then she was falling, not to the
marble floor, slick with blood and vomit, but down some bloodwarm well,
into silence and the dark.

The  Panther  Modern  leader,  who  introduced  himself  as  Lupus  Yonderboy,
wore a polycarbon suit with a recording feature that allowed him to replay
backgrounds   at   will.   Perched   on   the   edge   of   Case's   worktable   like   some
kind   of   state   of   the   art   gargoyle,   he   regarded   Case   and   Armitage   with
hooded eyes. He smiled. His hair was pink. A rainbow forest of microsofts
bristled behind his left ear; the ear was pointed, tufted with more pink hair.
His  pupils  had  been  modified  to  catch  the  light  like  a  cat's.  Case  watched
the suit crawl with color and texture.

"You let it get out of control," Armitage said. He stood in the center of the
loft like a statue, wrapped in the dark glossy folds of an expensive-looking
trenchcoat.

"Chaos, Mr.~ Who," Lupus Yonderboy said. "That is our mode and modus.
That  is  our  central  kick.  Your  woman  knows.  We  deal  with  her.  Not  with
you, Mr.~ Who." His suit had taken on a weird angular pattern of beige and
pale avocado. "She needed her medical team. She's with them. We'll watch
out for her. Everything's fine." He smiled again.

"Pay him," Case said.

Armitage glared at him. "We don't have the goods."

"Your woman has it," Yonderboy said.

"Pay him."

name.   A   beer   vendor   was   wiping   his   taps   with   a   dark   rag.   One   white
sneaker had come off, somehow, and lay beside her head.

Follow  the  wall.  Curve  of  concrete.  Hands  in  pockets.  Keep  walking.  Past
unseeing faces, every eye raised to the victor's image above the ring. Once a
seamed  European  face  danced  in  the  glare  of  a  match,  lips  pursed  around
the  short  stem  of  a  metal  pipe.  Tang  of  hashish.  Case  walked  on,  feeling
nothing.

"Case." Her mirrors emerged from deeper shadow. "You okay?"

Something mewled and bubbled in the dark behind her.

He shook his head.

"Fight's over, Case. Time to go home."

He  tried  to  walk  past  her,  back  into  the  dark,  where  something  was  dying.
She  stopped  him  with  a  hand  on  his  chest.  "Friends  of  your  tight  friend.
Killed your girl for you. You haven't done too well for friends in this town,
have  you?  We  got  a  partial  profile  on  that  old  bastard  when  we  did  you,
man. He'd fry anybody, for a few New ones. The one back there said they
got  on  to  her  when  she  was  trying  to  fence  your  RAM.  Just  cheaper  for
them to kill her and take it. Save a little money... I got the one who had the
laser  to  tell  me  all  about  it.  Coincidence  we  were  here,  but  I  had  to  make
sure." Her mouth was hard, lips pressed into a thin line.

Case   felt   as   though   his   brain   were   jammed.   "Who,"   he   said,   "who   sent
them?"

She  passed  him  a  blood-flecked  bag  of  preserved  ginger.  He  saw  that  her
hands   were   sticky   with   blood.   Back   in   the   shadows,   someone   made   wet
sounds and died.

After   the   postoperative   check   at   the   clinic,   Molly   took   him   to   the   port.
Armitage  was  waiting.  He'd  chartered  a  hovercraft.  The  last  Case  saw  of
Chiba  were  the  dark  angles  of  the  arcologies.  Then  a  mist  closed  over  the
black water and the drifting shoals of waste.

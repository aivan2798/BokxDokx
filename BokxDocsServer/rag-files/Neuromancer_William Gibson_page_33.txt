She  laughed.  Small  strong  hands  gripped  his  upper  arms.  "Sorry,  hotshot.
Eight   day   wait.   Your   nervous   system   would   fall   out   on   the   floor   if   you
jacked in now. Doctor's orders. Besides, they figure it worked. Check you in
a day or so." He lay down again.

"Where are we?"

"Home. Cheap Hotel."

"Where's Armitage?"

"Hilton,  selling  beads  to  the  natives  or  something.  We're  out  of  here  soon,
man. Amsterdam, Paris, then back to the Sprawl." She touched his shoulder.
"Roll over. I give a good massage."

He  lay  on  his  stomach,  arms  stretched  forward,  tips  of  his  fingers  against
the  walls  of  the  coffin.  She  settled  over  the  small  of  his  back,  kneeling  on
the temperfoam, the leather jeans cool against his skin. Her fingers brushed
his neck.

"How come you're not at the Hilton?"

She     answered     him     by     reaching     back,     between     his     thighs,     and     gently
encircling  his  scrotum  with  thumb  and  forefinger.  She  rocked  there  for  a
minute in the dark, erect above him, her other hand on his neck. The leather
of her jeans creaked softly with the movement. Case shifted, feeling himself
harden against the temperfoam.

His   head   throbbed,   but   the   brittleness   in   his   neck   seemed   to   retreat.   He
raised himself on one elbow, rolled, sank back against the foam, pulling her
down,  licking  her  breasts,  small  hard  nipples  sliding  wet  across  his  cheek.
He found the zip on the leather jeans and tugged it down.

"It's   okay,"   she   said,   "I   can   see."   Sound   of   the   jeans   peeling   down.   She
struggled beside him until she could kick them away. She threw a leg across
him and he touched her face. Unexpected hardness of the implanted lenses.
"Don't," she said, "fingerprints."

stuff? Smith didn't think so. Spook biz has a vibe, you get so you can smell
it.  Well,  I  had  my  cowboy  buzz  the  news  morgues  until  we  found  Tessier-
Ashpool  in  litigation.  The  case  wasn't  anything,  but  we  got  the  law  firm.
Then  he  did  the  lawyer's  ice  and  we  got  the  family  address.  Lotta  good  it
did us."

Case raised his eyebrows.

"Freeside," the Finn said. "The spindle. Turns out they own damn near the
whole thing. The interesting stuff was the picture we got when the cowboy
ran   a   regular   go-to   on   the   news   morgues   and   compiled   a   precis.   Family
organization. Corporate structure. Supposedly you can buy into an S.A., but
there  hasn't  been  a  share  of  Tessier-Ashpool  traded  on  the  open  market  in
over a hundred years. On any market, as far as I know. You're looking at a
very    quiet,    very    eccentric    first-generation    high    orbit    family,    run    like    a
corporation. Big money, very shy of media. Lot of cloning. Orbital law's a
lot softer on genetic engineering, right? And it's hard to keep track of which
generation,  or  combination  of  generations,  is  running  the  show  at  a  given
time."

"How's that?" Molly asked.

"Got their own cryogenic setup. Even under orbital law, you're legally dead
for the duration of a freeze. Looks like they trade off, though nobody's seen
the   founding   father   in   about   thirty   years.   Founding   momma,   she   died   in
some lab accident..."

"So what happened with your fence?"

"Nothing." The Finn frowned. "Dropped it. We had a look at this fantastic
tangle of powers of attorney the T-A's have, and that was it. Jimmy must've
gotten  into  Straylight,  lifted  the  head,  and  Tessier-Ashpool  sent  their  ninja
after it. Smith decided to forget about it. Maybe he was smart." He looked
at Molly. "The Villa Straylight. Tip of the spindle. Strictly private."

"You figure they own that ninja, Finn?" Molly asked.

"Smith thought so."

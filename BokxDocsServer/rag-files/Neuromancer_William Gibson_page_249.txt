"Peter," 3Jane said, "don't you know he does it in the dark? Zen. It's the way
he practices."

The  ninja  notched  his  arrow.  "Will  you  distract  me  with  your  holograms
now?"

Riviera    was    backing    away,    into    the    dark    beyond    the    pool.    He    brushed
against a white chair; its feet rattled on the tile. Hideo's arrow twitched.

Riviera broke and ran, throwing himself over a low, jagged length of wall.
The ninja's face was rapt, suffused with a quiet ecstasy.

Smiling, he padded off into the shadows beyond the wall, his weapon held
ready.

"Jane-lady,"   Maelcum   whispered,   and   Case   turned,   to   see   him   scoop   the
shotgun  from  the  tiles,  blood  spattering  the  white  ceramic.  He  shook  his
locks  and  lay  the  fat  barrel  in  the  crook  of  his  wounded  arm.  "This  take
your head off, no Babylon doctor fix it."

3Jane stared at the Remington. Molly freed her arms from the folds of the
striped blanket, raising the black sphere that encased her hands. "Off," she
said, "get it off."

Case rose from the tiles, shook himself. "Hideo'll get him, even blind?" he
asked 3Jane.

"When I was a child," she said, "we loved to blindfold him. He put arrows
through the pips in playing cards at ten meters."

"Peter's  good  as  dead  anyway,"  Molly  said.  "In  another  twelve  hours,  he'll
start to freeze up. Won't be able to move, his eyes is all."

"Why?" Case turned to her.

"I poisoned his shit for him," she said. "Condition's like Parkinson's disease,
sort of."

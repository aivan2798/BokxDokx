boredom. Got the attention span of a gnat, Case thought, watching the boy's
brown eyes.

Their    room    was    smaller    than    the    one    Case    shared    with    Molly,    and    on
another level, closer to the surface. Five huge Cibachromes of Tally Isham
were     taped     across     the     glass     of     the     balcony,     suggesting     an     extended
residency.

"They're   def   triff,   huh?"   Cath   asked   seeing   him   eye   the   transparencies.
"Mine. Shot 'em at the S/N Pyramid, last time we went down the well. She
was _that_ close, and she just smiled, _so_ natural. And it was _bad_ there,
Lupus,   day   after   these   Christ   the   King   terrs   put   angel   in   the   water,   you
know?"

"Yeah," Case said, suddenly uneasy, "terrible thing."

"Well," Bruce cut in, "about this beta you want to buy..."

"Thing is, can I metabolize it?" Case raised his eyebrows.

"Tell you what," the boy said. "You do a taste. If you pancreas passes on it,
it's on the house. First time's free."

"I heard that one before," Case said, taking the bright blue derm that Bruce
passed across the black bedspread.

"Case?" Molly sat up in bed and shook the hair away from her lenses.

"Who else, honey?"

"What's got into you?" The mirrors followed him across the room.

"I    forget    how    to    pronounce    it,"    he    said,    taking    a    tighty    rolled    strip    of
bubble-packed blue derms from his shirt pocket.

"Christ," she said, "just what we needed."

"Truer words were never spoken."

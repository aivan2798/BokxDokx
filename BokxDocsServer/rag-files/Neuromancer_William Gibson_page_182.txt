"I spit," she said. "The ducts are routed back into my mouth."

"Then  you've  already  learned  an  important  lesson,  for  one  so  young."  He
rested the hand with the pistol on his knee and took a bottle from the table
beside    him,    without    bothering    to    choose    from    the    half-dozen    different
liquors. He drank. Brandy. A trickle of the stuff ran from the corner of his
mouth. "That is the way to handle tears." He drank again. "I'm busy tonight,
Molly. I built all this, and now I'm busy. Dying."

"I could go out the way I came," she said.

He laughed, a harsh high sound. "You intrude on my suicide and then ask to
simply walk out? Really, you amaze me. A thief."

"It's  my  ass,  boss,  and  it's  all  I  got.  I  just  wanna  get  it  out  of  here  in  one

"What about?" She sat. Case felt the blades move, very slightly, beneath her
nails.

"Whatever  comes  to  mind.  My  mind.  It's  my  party.  The  cores  woke  me.
Twenty hours ago. Something was afoot, they said, and I was needed. Were
you  the  something  Molly?  Surely  they  didn't  need  me  to  handle  you,  no.
Something   else...   but   I'd   been   dreaming,   you   see.   For   thirty   years.   You
weren't  born,  when  last  I  lay  me  down  to  sleep.  They  told  us  we  wouldn't
dream,   in   that   cold.   They   told   us   we'd   never   feel   cold,   either.   Madness,
Molly.  Lies.  Of  course  I  dreamed.  The  cold  let  the  outside  in,  that  was  it.
The  outside.  All  the  night  I  built  this  to  hide  us  from.  Just  a  drop,  at  first,

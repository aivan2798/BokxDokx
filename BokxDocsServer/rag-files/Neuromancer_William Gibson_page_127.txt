"Mon,  you  doin'~  jus'~  fine,"  Maelcum  said,  helping  Case  out  of  the  red
Sanyo    vacuum    suit.    "Aerol    say    you    doin'~    jus'~    fine."    Aerol    had    been
waiting   at   one   of   the   sporting   docks   at   the   end   of   the   spindle,   near   the
weightless axis. To reach it, Case had taken an elevator down to the hull and
ridden a miniature induction train. As the diameter of the spindle narrowed,
gravity    decreased;    somewhere    above    him,    he'd    decided,    would    be    the
mountains   Molly   climbed,   the   bicycle   loop,   launching   gear   for   the   hang
gliders and miniature microlights.

Aerol  had  ferried  him  out  to  _Marcus  Garvey_  in  a  skeletal  scooter  frame
with a chemical engine.

"Two hour ago," Maelcum said, "I take delivery of Babylon goods for you;
nice Japan-boy inna yacht, mos'~ pretty yacht."

Free of the suit, Case pulled himself gingerly over the Hosaka and fumbled
into the straps of the web. "Well," he said, "let's see it."

Maelcum produced a white lump of foam slightly smaller than Case's head,
fished a pearl-handled switchblade on a green nylon lanyard out of the hip
pocket  of  his  tattered  shorts  and  carefully  slit  the  plastic.  He  extracted  a
rectangular object and passed it to Case. "Thas part some gun, mon?"

"No," Case said, turning it over, "but it's a weapon. It's virus."

"Not on _this_ boy tug, mon," Maelcum said firmly, reaching for the steel
cassette.

"A   program.   Virus   program.   Can't   get   into   you,   can't   even   get   into   your
software.  I've  got  to  interface  it  through  the  deck,  before  it  can  work  on
anything."

"Well.      Japan-mon,      he      says      Hosaka      here'll      tell      you      every      what      an'~
wherefore, you wanna know."

"Okay. Well, you leave me to it, okay?"

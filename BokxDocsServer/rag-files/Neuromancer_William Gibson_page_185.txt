"Got   your   boss   on   hold,"   the   Flatline   said.   "He's   coming   through   on   the
twin Hosaka in that boat upstairs, the one that's riding us piggy-back. Called
the _Haniwa.'_

"I know," Case said, absently, "I saw it."

A   lozenge   of   white   light   clicked   into   place   in   front   of   him,   hiding   the
Tessier-Ashpool    ice;    it    showed    him    the    calm,    perfectly    focused,    utterly
crazy face of Armitage, his eyes blank as buttons. Armitage blinked. Stared.

"Guess  Wintermute  took  care  of  your  Turings  too,  huh?  Like  he  took  care
of mine," Case said.

Armitage stared. Case resisted the sudden urge to look away, drop his gaze.
"You okay, Armitage?"

"Case" -and for an instant something seemed to move, behind the blue stare
-"you've seen Wintermute, haven't you? In the matrix."

Case   nodded.   A   camera   on   the   face   of   his   Hosaka   in   _Marcus   Garvey_
would  relay  the  gesture  to  the  _Haniwa_  monitor.  He  imagined  Maelcum
listening to his tranced half conversations, unable to hear the voices of the
construct or Armitage.

"Case"  -and  the  eyes  grew  larger,  Armitage  leaning  toward  his  computer  -
"what is he, when you see him?"

"A high-rez simstim construct."

"But _who?'_

"Finn, last time... Before that, this pimp I..."

"Not General Girling?"

"General who?"

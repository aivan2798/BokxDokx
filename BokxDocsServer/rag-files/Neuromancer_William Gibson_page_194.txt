"Colonel,  I  hear  you,  man.  Listen,  Colonel,  okay?  I  want  you  to  open  the,
ah... shit, what's it called, Dix?"

"The midbay lock," the Flatline said.

"Open the midbay lock. Just tell your central console there to open it, right?
We'll be up there with you fast, Colonel. Then we can talk about getting out
of here."

The lozenge vanished.

"Boy, I think you just lost me, there," the Flatline said.

"The toxins," Case said, "the fucking toxins," and jacked out.

"Poison?"   Maelcum   watched   over   the   scratched   blue   shoulder   of   his   old
Sanyo as Case struggled out of the g-web.

"And get this goddam thing off me..." Tugging at the Texas catheter. "Like a
slow  poison,  and  that  asshole  upstairs  knows  how  to  counter  it,  and  now
he's   crazier   than   a   shithouse   rat."   He   fumbled   with   the   front   of   the   red
Sanyo, forgetting how to work the seals.

"Bossman,     he     _poison_     you?"     Maelcum     scratched     his     cheek.     "Got     a
medical kit, ya know."

"Maelcum, Christ, help me with this goddam suit."

The  Zionite  kicked  off  from  the  pink  pilot  module.  "Easy,  mon.  Measure
twice, cut once, wise man put it. We get up there..."

There was air in the corrugated gangway that led from _Marcus Garvey_'s
aft lock to the midbay lock of the yacht called _Haniwa,_ but they kept their
suits     sealed.     Maelcum     executed     the     passage     with     balletic     grace,     only
pausing to help Case, who'd gone into an awkward tumble as he'd stepped
out    of    _Garvey._    The    white    plastic    sides    of    the    tube    filtered    the    raw
sunlight; there were no shadows.

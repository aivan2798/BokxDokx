came out later. Knew about the emps, magnetic pulse weapons. Sent these
fellows in regardless, just to see." Deane shrugged. "Turkey shoot for Ivan."

"Any of those guys make it out?"

"Christ," Deane said, "it's been bloody years... Though I do think a few did.
One of the teams. Got hold of a Sov gunship. Helicopter, you know. Flew it
back to Finland. Didn't have entry codes, of course, and shot hell out of the
Finnish defense forces in the process. Special Forces types." Deane sniffed.
"Bloody hell."

Case nodded. The smell of preserved ginger was overwhelming.

"I  spent  the  war  in  Lisbon,  you  know,"  Deane  said,  putting  the  gun  down.
"Lovely place, Lisbon."

"In the service, Julie?"

"Hardly. Though I did see action." Deane smiled his pink smile. "Wonderful
what a war can do for one's markets."

"Thanks, Julie. I owe you one."

"Hardly, Case. And goodbye."

And later he'd tell himself that the evening at Sammi's had felt wrong from
the   start,   that   even   as   he'd   followed   Molly   along   that   corridor,   shuffling

They'd gone to the Namban, after he'd seen Deane, and paid off his debt to
Wage with a roll of Armitage's New Yen. Wage had liked that, his boys had
liked  it  less,  and  Molly  had  grinned  at  Case's  side  with  a  kind  of  ecstatic
feral  intensity,  obviously  longing  for  one  of  them  to  make  a  move.  Then
he'd taken her back to the Chat for a drink.

"Wasting your time, cowboy," Molly said, when Case took an octagon from
the pocket of his jacket.

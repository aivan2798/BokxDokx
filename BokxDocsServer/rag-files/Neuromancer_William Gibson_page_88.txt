"You  have  told  this  to  your  woman  friend?"  Terzibashjian  leaned  forward
between  the  ultrasuede  buckets.  "In  Turkey,  women  are  still  women.  This
one..."

The Finn snorted. "She'd have you wearing your balls for a bow tie if you
looked at her cross-eyed."

"I do not understand this idiom."

"That's okay," Case said. "Means shut up."

The Armenian sat back, leaving a metallic edge of aftershave. He began to
whisper to a Sanyo transceiver in a strange salad of Greek, French, Turkish,
isolated   fragments   of   English.   The   transceiver   answered   in   French.   The
Mercedes  swung  smoothly  around  a  corner.  "The  spice  bazaar,  sometimes
called   the   Egyptian   bazaar,"   the   car   said,   "was   erected   on   the   site   of   an
earlier  bazaar  erected  by  Sultan  Hatice  in  1660.  This  is  the  city's  central
market for spices, software, perfumes, drugs..."

"Drugs,"     Case     said,     watching     the     car's     wipers     cross     and     recross     the
bulletproof  Lexan.  "What's  that  you  said  before,  Jersey,  about  this  Riviera
being wired?"

"A  mixture  of  cocaine  and  meperidine,  yes."  The  Armenian  went  back  to
the conversation he was having with the Sanyo.

"Demerol   they   used   to   call   that,"   said   the   Finn.   "He's   a   speedball   artist.
Funny class of people you're mixing with, Case."

"Never  mind,"  Case  said,  turning  up  the  collar  of  his  jacket,  "we'll  get  the
poor fucker a new pancreas or something."

Once they entered the bazaar, the Finn brightened noticeably, as though he
were   comforted   by   the   crowd   density   and   the   sense   of   enclosure.   They
walked  with  the  Armenian  along  a  broad  concourse,  beneath  soot-stained
sheets   of   plastic   and   green-painted   ironwork   out   of   the   age   of   steam.   A
thousand suspended ads writhed and flickered.

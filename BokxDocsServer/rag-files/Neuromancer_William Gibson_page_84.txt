"'Cause you get up his nose. You're sure getting up mine."

He  wanted  to  tell  her  the  Corto  story,  but  decided  against  it.  He'd  used  a
sleep derm, on the plane.

The  road  in  from  the  airport  had  been  dead  straight,  like  a  neat  incision,
laying  the  city  open.  He'd  watched  the  crazy  walls  of  patchwork  wooden
tenements  slide  by,  condos,  arcologies,  grim  housing  projects,  more  walls
of plyboard and corrugated iron.

The Finn, in a new Shinjuku suit, sarariman black, was waiting sourly in the
Hilton lobby, marooned on a velour armchair in a sea of pale blue carpeting.

"Christ," Molly said. "Rat in a business suit."

They crossed the lobby.

"How  much  you  get  paid  to  come  over  here,  Finn?"  She  lowered  her  bag
beside   the   armchair.   "Bet   not   as   much   as   you   get   for   wearing   that   suit,
huh?"

The Finn's upper lips drew back. "Not enough, sweetmeat." He handed her
a     magnetic     key     with     a     round     yellow     tag.     "You're     registered     already.
Honcho's upstairs." He looked around. "This town sucks."

"You  get  agoraphobic,  they  take  you  out  from  under  a  dome.  Just  pretend
it's Brooklyn or something." She twirled the key around a finger. "You here
as valet or what?"

"I gotta check out some guy's implants," the Finn said.

"How about my deck?" Case asked.

The Finn winced. "Observe the protocol. Ask the boss."

Molly's  fingers  moved  in  the  shadow  of  her  jacket,  a  flicker  of  jive.  The
Finn watched, then nodded.

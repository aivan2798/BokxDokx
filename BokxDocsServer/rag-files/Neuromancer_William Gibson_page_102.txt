Armitage  announced  an  eighty-hour  stay  in  Zion.  Molly  and  Case  would
practice  in  zero  gravity,  he  said,  and  acclimatize  themselves  to  working  in
it. He would brief them on Freeside and the Villa Straylight. It was unclear
what Riviera was supposed to be doing, but Case didn't feel like asking. A
few hours after their arrival, Armitage had sent him into the yellow maze to
call Riviera out for a meal. He'd found him curled like a cat on a thin pad of
temperfoam, naked, apparently asleep, his head orbited by a revolving halo
of     small     white     geometric     forms,     cubes,     spheres,     and     pyramids.     "Hey,
Riviera." The ring continued to revolve. He'd gone back and told Armitage.
"He's  stoned,"  Molly  said,  looking  up  from  the  disassembled  parts  of  her
fletcher. "Leave him be."

Armitage seemed to think that zero-g would affect Case's ability to operate
in the matrix. "Don't sweat it," Case argued, "I jack in and I'm not here. It's
all the same."

"Your  adrenaline  levels  are  higher,"  Armitage  said.  "You've  still  got  SAS.
You  won't  have  time  for  it  to  wear  off.  You're  going  to  learn  to  work  with
it."

"So I do the run from here?"

"No. Practice, Case. Now. Up in the corridor..."

Cyberspace, as the deck presented it, had no particular relationship with the
deck's  physical  whereabouts.  When  Case  jacked  in,  he  opened  his  eyes  to
the familiar configuration of the Eastern Seaboard Fission Authority's Aztec
pyramid of data.

"How you doing, Dixie?"

"I'm dead, Case. Got enough time in on this Hosaka to figure that one."

"How's it feel?"

"It doesn't."

"Bother you?"

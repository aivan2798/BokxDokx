"Dub, mon," Maelcum said.

"You're fucking crazy," Case told him.

"Hear okay, mon. Righteous dub."

"Hey, guys," the Finn said, "on your toes. Here comes your transportation. I
can't finesse many numbers as smooth as the pic of 8Jean that conned your
doorman, but I can get you a ride over to 3Jane's place."

Case was pulling the adaptor from its socket when the riderless service cart
swiveled into sight, under the graceless concrete arch marking the far end of
their corridor. It might have been the one his Africans had ridden, but if it
was, they were gone now. Just behind the back of the low padded seat, its
tiny    manipulators    gripping    the    upholstery,    the    little    Braun    was    steadily
winking its red LED.

"Bus to catch," Case said to Maelcum.

He'd lost his anger again. He missed it.

The little cart was crowded: Maelcum, the Remington across his knees, and
Case, deck and construct against his chest. The cart was operating at speeds
it  hadn't  been  designed  for,  it  was  top  heavy,  cornering,  and  Maelcum  had
taken to leaning out in the direction of the turns. This presented no problem
when  the  thing  took  lefts,  because  Case  sat  on  the  right,  but  in  the  right
turns the Zionite had to lean across Case and his gear, crushing him against
the seat.

He  had  no  idea  where  they  were.  Everything  was  familiar,  but  he  couldn't
be sure he'd seen any particular stretch before. A curving hallway lined with
wooden showcases displayed collections he was certain he'd never seen: the
skulls  of  large  birds,  coins,  masks  of  beaten  silver.  The  service  cart's  six
tires  were  silent  on  the  layered  carpets.  There  was  only  the  whine  of  the
electric   motor   and   an   occasional   faint   burst   of   Zion   dub,   from   the   foam
beads  in  Maelcum's  ears,  as  he  lunged  past  Case  to  counter  a  sharp  right.

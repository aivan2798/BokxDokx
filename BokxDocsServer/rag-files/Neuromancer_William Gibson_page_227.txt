ordered    designed    into    the    original    software,    but    she    was    an    extremely
secretive woman when she felt it necessary. Here. Drink." She put a flexible
plastic tube to Molly's lips. "Water. Only a little."

"Jane,  love,"  Riviera  asked  cheerfully,  from  somewhere  out  of  sight,  "are
you enjoying yourself?"

"Leave us alone, Peter."

"Playing   doctor..."   Suddenly   Molly   stared   into   her   own   face,   the   image
suspended ten centimeters from her nose. There were no bandages. The left
implant   was   shattered,   a   long   finger   of   silvered   plastic   driven   deep   in   a
socket that was an inverted pool of blood.

"Hideo,"  3Jane  said,  stroking  Molly's  stomach,  _"hurt_  Peter  if  he  doesn't
go away. Go and swim, Peter."

The projection vanished.

"He said you know the code. Peter said. Wintermute needs the code." Case
was  suddenly  aware  of  the  Chubb  key  that  lay  on  its  nylon  thong,  against
the inner curve of her left breast.

"Yes,"  3Jane  said,  withdrawing  her  hand,  "I  do.  I  learned  it  as  a  child.  I
think I learned it in a dream... Or somewhere in the thousand hours of my
mother's   diaries.   But   I   think   that   Peter   has   a   point,   in   urging   me   not   to
surrender    it.    There    would    be    Turing    to    contend    with,    if    I    read    all    this
correctly, and ghosts are nothing if not capricious."

Case jacked out.

"Strange little customer, huh?" The Finn grinned at Case from the old Sony.

Case shrugged. He saw Maelcum coming back along the corridor with the
Remington   at   his   side.   The   Zionite   was   smiling,   his   head   bobbing   to   a
rhythm Case couldn't hear. A pair of thin yellow leads ran from his ears to a
side pocket in his sleeveless jacket.

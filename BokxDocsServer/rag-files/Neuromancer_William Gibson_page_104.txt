He  took  the  band,  put  it  on,  and  Case  adjusted  the  trodes.  He  closed  his
eyes. Case hit the power stud. Aerol shuddered. Case jacked him back out.
"What did you see, man?"

"Babylon," Aerol said, sadly, handing him the trodes and kicking off down
the corridor.

Riviera sat motionless on his foam pad, his right arm extended straight out,
level with his shoulder. A jewel-scaled snake, its eyes like ruby neon, was
coiled tightly a few millimeters behind his elbow. Case watched the snake,
which    was    finger-thick    and    banded    black    and    scarlet,    slowly    contract,
tightening around Riviera's arm.

"Come then," the man said caressingly to the pale waxy scorpion poised in
the center of his upturned palm. "Come." The scorpion swayed its brownish
claws   and   scurried   up   his   arm   its   feet   tracking   the   faint   dark   telltales   of
veins.   When   it   reached   the   inner   elbow,   it   halted   and   seemed   to   vibrate.
Riviera  made  a  soft  hissing  sound.  The  sting  came  up,  quivered,  and  sank
into  the  skin  above  a  bulging  vein.  The  coral  snake  relaxed,  and  Riviera
sighed slowly as the injection hit him.

Then  the  snake  and  the  scorpion  were  gone,  and  he  held  a  milky  plastic
syringe   in   his   left   hand.   ""If   God   made   anything   better,   he   kept   it   for
himself." You know the expression, Case?"

"Yeah,"  Case  said.  "I  heard  that  about  lots  of  different  things.  You  always
make it into a little show?"

Riviera loosened and removed the elastic length of surgical tubing from his
arm. "Yes. It's more fun." He smiled, his eyes distant now, cheeks flushed.
"I've a membrane set in, just over the vein, so I never have to worry about
the condition of the needle."

"Doesn't hurt?"

The bright eyes met his. "Of course it does. That's part of it, isn't it?"

"I'd just use derms," Case said.

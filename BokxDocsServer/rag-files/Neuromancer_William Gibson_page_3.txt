"Sure," Case said, and sipped his beer. "Somebody's gotta be funny around
here. Sure the fuck isn't you."

The whore's giggle went up an octave.

"Isn't  you  either,  sister.  So  you  vanish,  okay?  Zone,  he's  a  close  personal
friend of mine."

She looked Case in the eye and made the softest possible spitting sound, her

The   Japanese   had   already   forgotten   more   neurosurgery   than   the   Chinese
had  ever  known.  The  black  clinics  of  Chiba  were  the  cutting  edge,  whole
bodies  of  technique  supplanted  monthly,  and  still  they  couldn't  repair  the
damage he'd suffered in that Memphis hotel.

A year here and he still dreamed of cyberspace, hope fading nightly. All the
speed he took, all the turns he'd taken and the corners he'd cut in Night City,
and  still  he'd  see  the  matrix  in  his  sleep,  bright  lattices  of  logic  unfolding

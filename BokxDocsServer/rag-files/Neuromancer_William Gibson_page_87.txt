management has grown nervous." He smiled. He smelled of some metallic
aftershave.

"I want to know about the implants," she said, massaging her thigh, "I want
to know exactly what he can do."

Terzibashjian nodded. "Worst is how you say in _Ingiliz,_ the subliminals."
He made the word four careful syllables.

"On   our   left,"   said   the   Mercedes,   as   it   steered   through   a   maze   of   rainy
streets, "is Kapali Carsi, the grand bazaar."

Beside Case, the Finn made an appreciative noise, but he was looking in the
wrong    direction.    The    right    side    of    the    street    was    lined    with    miniature
scrapyards. Case saw a gutted locomotive atop rust-stained, broken lengths
of fluted marble. Headless marble statues were stacked like firewood.

"Homesick?" Case asked.

"Place  sucks,"  the  Finn  said.  His  black  silk  tie  was  starting  to  resemble  a
worn  carbon  ribbon.  There  were  medallions  of  kebab  gravy  and  fried  egg
on the lapels of the new suit.

"Hey,  Jersey,"  Case  said  to  the  Armenian,  who  sat  behind  them,  "where'd
this guy get his stuff installed?"

"In Chiba City. He has no left lung. The other is boosted, is how you say it?
Anyone    might    buy    these    implants,    but    this    one    is    most    talented."    The
Mercedes swerved avoiding a balloon-tired dray stacked with hides. "I have
followed him in the street and seen a dozen cycles fall, near him, in a day.
Find   the   cyclist   in   a   hospital,   the   story   is   always   the   same.   A   scorpion
poised beside a brake lever..."

""What     you     see     is     what     you     get,"     yeah,"     the     Finn     said.     "I     seen     the
schematics  on  the  guy's  silicon.  Very  flash.  What  he  imagines,  you  see.  I
figure he could narrow it to a pulse and fry a retina over easy."

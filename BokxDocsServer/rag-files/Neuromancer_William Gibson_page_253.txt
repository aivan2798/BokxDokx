complexity that cut the eye, jewel bright, sharp as razors.

"Hey,   shit,"   the   construct   said,   "those   things   are   the   RCA   Building.   You
know the old RCA Building?" The Kuang program dived past the gleaming
spires  of  a  dozen  identical  towers  of  data,  each  one  a  blue  neon  replica  of
the Manhattan skyscraper.

"You ever see resolution this high?" Case asked.

"No, but I never cracked an AI, either."

"This thing know where it's going?"

"It better."

They were dropping, losing altitude in a canyon of rainbow neon.

"Dix --"

An arm of shadow was uncoiling from the flickering floor below, a seething
mass of darkness, unformed, shapeless...

"Company,"   the   Flatline   said,   as   Case   hit   the   representation   of   his   deck,
fingers       flying       automatically       across       the       board.       The       Kuang       swerved
sickeningly, then reversed, whipping itself backward, shattering the illusion
of a physical vehicle.

The   shadow   thing   was   growing,   spreading,   blotting   out   the   city   of   data.
Case took them straight up, above them the distanceless bowl of jade-green
ice.

The city of the cores was gone now, obscured entirely by the dark beneath
them.

"What is it?"

"An  AI's  defense  system,"  the  construct  said,  "or  part  of  it.  If  it's  your  pal
Wintermute, he's not lookin'~ real friendly."

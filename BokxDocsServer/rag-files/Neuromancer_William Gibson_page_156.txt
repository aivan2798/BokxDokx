PART FOUR - THE STRAYLIGHT RUN

"Your  name  is  Henry  Dorsett  Case."  She  recited  the  year  and  place  of  his
birth,  his  BAMA  Single  Identification  Number,  and  a  string  of  names  he
gradually recognized as aliases from his past.

"You been here awhile?" He saw the contents of his bag spread out across
the    bed,    unwashed    clothing    sorted    by    type.    The    shuriken    lay    by    itself,
between jeans and underwear, on the sand-tinted temperfoam.

"Where is Kolodny?" The two men sat side by side on the couch, their arms
crossed  over  tanned  chests,  identical  gold  chains  slung  around  their  necks.
Case peered at them and saw that their youth was counterfeit, marked by a
certain   telltale   corrugation   at   the   knuckles,   something   the   surgeons   were
unable to erase.

"Who's Kolodny?"

"That was the name in the register. Where is she?"

"I   dunno,"   he   said,   crossing   to   the   bar   and   pouring   himself   a   glass   of
mineral water. "She took off."

"Where did you go tonight, Case?" The girl picked up the pistol and rested
it on her thigh, without actually pointing it at him.

"Jules   Verne,   couple   of   bars,   got   high.   How   about   you?"   His   knees   felt
brittle. The mineral water was warm and flat.

"I  don't  think  you  grasp  your  situation,"  said  the  man  on  the  left,  taking  a
pack of Gitanes from the breast pocket of his white mesh blouse. "You are
busted, Mr.~ Case. The charges have to do with conspiracy to augment an
artificial  intelligence."  He  took  a  gold  Dunhill  from  the  same  pocket  and
cradled it in his palm. "The man you call Armitage is already in custody."

"Corto?"

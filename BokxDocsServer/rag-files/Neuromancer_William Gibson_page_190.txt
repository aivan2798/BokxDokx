"Maelcum..."

"Mon,  you  bossman  gone  ver'~  strange."  The  Zionite  was  wearing  a  blue
Sanyo   vacuum   suit   twenty   years   older   than   the   one   Case   had   rented   in
Freeside,  its  helmet  under  his  arm  and  his  dreadlocks  bagged  in  a  net  cap
crocheted   from   purple   cotton   yarn.   His   eyes   were   slitted   with   ganja   and
tension. "Keep callin'~ down here wi'~ _orders,_ mon, but be some Babylon
war..." Maelcum shook his head. "Aerol an'~ I talkin'~, an'~ Aerol talkin'~
wi'~  Zion,  Founders  seh  cut  an'~  run."  He  ran  the  back  of  a  large  brown
hand across his mouth.

"Armitage?" Case winced as the betaphenethylamine hangover hit him with
its full intensity, unscreened by the matrix or simstim. Brain's got no nerves
in it, he told himself, it can't really feel this bad. "What do you mean, man?
He's giving you orders? What?"

_Marcus Garvey_ and return."

"Armitage, he was wounded? Blood?"

"Can't seh, ya know? But blood, an'~ stone crazy, Case."

"Okay," Case said "So what about me? You're going home. What about me,
Maelcum?"

"Mon,"   Maelcum   said,   "you   comin'~   wi'~   me.   I   an'~   I   come   Zion   wi'~
Aerol, _Babylon Rocker._ Leave Mr.~ Armitage t'~ talk wi'~ ghost cassette,
one ghost t'~ 'nother..."

Case glanced over his shoulder: his rented suit swung against the hammock
where   he'd   snapped   it,   swaying   in   the   air   current   from   the   old   Russian
scrubber.   He   closed   his   eyes.   He   saw   the   sacs   of   toxin   dissolving   in   his

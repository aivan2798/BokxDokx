"Hideo, remove the arrow and bandage Mr.~ Malcolm's wound."

Case was staring at Molly, at the wan face.

The  ninja  walked  to  where  Maelcum  sat,  pausing  to  lay  his  bow  and  the
shotgun  well  out  of  reach,  and  took  something  from  his  pocket.  A  pair  of
bolt   cutters.   "I   must   cut   the   shaft,"   he   said.   "It   is   too   near   the   artery."
Maelcum nodded. His face was grayish and sheened with sweat.

Case looked at 3Jane. "There isn't much time," he said.

"For whom, exactly?"

"For any of us." There was a snap as Hideo cut through the metal shaft of
the arrow. Maelcum groaned.

"Really,"   Riviera   said,   "it   won't   amuse   you   to   hear   this   failed   con   artist
make  a  last  desperate  pitch.  Most  distasteful,  I  can  assure  you.  He'll  wind
up   on   his   knees,   offer   to   sell   you   his   mother,   perform   the   most   boring
sexual favors..."

3Jane threw back her head and laughed. "Wouldn't I, Peter?"

"The ghosts are gonna mix it tonight, lady," Case said. "Wintermute's going
up against the other one, Neuromancer. For keeps. You know that?"

3Jane  raised  her  eyebrows.  "Peter's  suggested  something  like  that,  but  tell
me more."

"I  met  Neuromancer.  He  talked  about  your  mother.  I  think  he's  something
like  a  giant  ROM  construct,  for  recording  personality,  only  it's  full  RAM.
The constructs think they're there, like it's real, but it just goes on forever."

3Jane  stepped  from  behind  the  bathchair.  "Where?  Describe  the  place,  this
construct."

"A beach. Gray sand, like silver that needs polishing. And a concrete thing,
kinda  bunker..."  He  hesitated.  "It's  nothing  fancy.  Just  old,  falling  apart.  If
you walk far enough, you come back to where you started."

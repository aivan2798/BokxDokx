She seemed to speak from a distance. "And I knew, but I kept quiet about it.
I  needed  the  money.  The  dreams  got  worse  and  worse,  and  I'd  tell  myself
that  at  least  some  of  them  _were_  just  dreams,  but  by  then  I'd  started  to
figure  that  the  boss  had  a  whole  little  _clientele_  going  for  me.  Nothing's
too good for Molly, the boss says, and gives me this shit raise." She shook
her head. "That prick was charging _eight_ times what he was paying me,
and he thought I didn't know."

"So what was he charging for?"

"Bad  dreams.  Real  ones.  One  night...  one  night,  I'd  just  come  back  from
Chiba."   She   dropped   the   cigarette,   ground   it   out   with   her   heel,   and   sat
down,  leaning  against  the  wall.  "Surgeons  went  way  in,  that  trip.  Tricky.
They   must   have   disturbed   the   cut-out   chip.   I   came   up.   I   was   into   this
routine with a customer..." She dug her fingers deep in the foam. "Senator,
he was. Knew his fat face right away. We were both covered with blood. We
weren't  alone.  She  was  all..."  She  tugged  at  the  temperfoam.  "Dead.  And
that  fat  prick,  he  was  saying,  "What's  wrong.  What's  wrong?"  'Cause  we
weren't _finished_ yet..."

She began to shake.

"So   I   guess   I   gave   the   Senator   what   he   really   wanted,   you   know?"   The
shaking  stopped.  She  released  the  foam  and  ran  her  fingers  back  through
her   dark   hair.   "The   house   put   a   contract   out   on   me.   I   had   to   hide   for   a
while."

Case stared at her.

"So Riviera hit a nerve last night," she said. "I guess it wants me to hate him
real bad, so I'll be psyched up to go in there after him."

"After him?"

"He's   already   there.   Straylight.   On   the   invitation   of   Lady   3Jane,   all   that
dedication shit. She was there in a private box, kinda..."

Case remembered the face he'd seen. "You gonna kill him?"

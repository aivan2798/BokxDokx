"'Im gone, mon." Maelcum looked at the monitor. "Hatch open. Mute mus'~
override ejection failsafe."

Case   tried   to   wipe   the   tears   of   rage   from   his   eyes.   His   fingers   clacked
against Lexan.

"Yacht,  she  tight  for  air,  but  bossman  takin'~  grapple  control  wi'~  bridge.
_Marcus Garvey_ still stuck."

But    Case    was    seeing    Armitage's    endless    fall    around    Freeside,    through
vacuum  colder  than  the  steppes.  For  some  reason,  he  imagined  him  in  his

Kuang  Grade  Mark  Eleven  was  filling  the  grid  between  itself  and  the  T-A
ice   with   hypnotically   intricate   traceries   of   rainbow,   lattices   fine   as   snow
crystal on a winter window.

"Wintermute    killed    Armitage.    Blew    him    out    in    a    lifeboat    with    a    hatch
open."

"Tough    shit,"    the    Flatline    said.    "Weren't    exactly    asshole    buddies,    were
you?"

"He knew how to unbond the toxin sacs."

"So Wintermute knows too. Count on it."

"I don't exactly trust Wintermute to give it to me."

The   construct's   hideous   approximation   of   laughter   scraped   Case's   nerves
like a dull blade. "Maybe that means you're gettin'~ smart."

He hit the simstim switch.

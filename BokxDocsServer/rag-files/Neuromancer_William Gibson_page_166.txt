Case jacked back in.

"Christ on a crutch," the Flatline said, "take a look at this."

The      Chinese      virus      was      unfolding      around      them.      Polychrome      shadow,
countless translucent layers shifting and recombining. Protean, enormous, it
towered above them, blotting out the void.

"Big mother," the Flatline said.

"I'm gonna check Molly," Case said, tapping the simstim switch.

Freefall.  The  sensation  was  like  diving  through  perfectly  clear  water.  She

Case    watched    the    blank    wall    that    screened    Straylight.    "Well,"    he    said,

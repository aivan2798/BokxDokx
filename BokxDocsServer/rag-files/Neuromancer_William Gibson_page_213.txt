Maelcum pulled himself up, over Case's head, twisted and peered over his
shoulder. "Now who is that mon, Case?"

"That's   just   a   picture,   Maelcum,"   Case   said   wearily.   "Guy   I   know   in   the
Sprawl.    It's    Wintermute    talking.    Picture's    supposed    to    make    us    feel    at
home."

"Bullshit," the Finn said. "Like I told Molly, these aren't masks. I need 'em
to   talk   to   you.   'Cause   I   don't   have   what   you'd   think   of   as   a   personality,
much. But all that's just pissing in the wind, Case, 'cause, like I just said, we
gotta problem."

"So express thyself, Mute," Maelcum said.

down,  she'd  walk  in,  get  Peter  out  of  the  way,  talk  the  magic  word  outa

"No.    Gotta    be    you.    Gotta    be    somebody    who    understands    Molly,    who
understands Riviera. Maelcum for muscle."

"You  maybe  forget  that  I'm  in  the  middle  of  a  little  run,  here.  Remember?
What you hauled my ass out here for..."

"Case, listen up. Time's tight. Very tight. Listen. The real link between your
deck   and   Straylight   is   a   sideband   broadcast   over   _Garvey_'s   navigation
system.  You'll  take  _Garvey_  into  a  very  private  dock  I'll  show  you.  The
Chinese  virus  has  completely  penetrated  the  fabric  of  the  Hosaka.  There's
nothing   in   the   Hosaka   but   virus   now.   When   you   dock,   the   virus   will   be
interfaced  with  the  Straylight  custodial  system  and  we'll  cut  the  sideband.
You'll take your deck, the Flatline, and Maelcum. You'll find 3Jane, get the

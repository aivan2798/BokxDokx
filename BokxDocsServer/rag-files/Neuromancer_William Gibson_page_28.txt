"Screaming Fist, Case. You've heard the name."

"Some  kind  of  run,  wasn't  it?  Tried  to  burn  this  Russian  nexus  with  virus
programs. Yeah, I heard about it. And nobody got out."

He  sensed  abrupt  tension.  Armitage  walked  to  the  window  and  looked  out
over Tokyo Bay. "That isn't true. One unit made it back to Helsinki, Case."

Case shrugged, sipped coffee.

"You're a console cowboy. The prototypes of the programs you use to crack
industrial banks were developed for Screaming Fist. For the assault on the
Kirensk computer nexus. Basic module was a Nightwing microlight, a pilot,
a  matrix  deck,  a  jockey.  We  were  running  a  virus  called  Mole.  The  Mole
series was the first generation of real intrusion programs."

"Icebreakers," Case said, over the rim of the red mug.

"Ice from _ICE,_ intrusion countermeasures electronics."

"Problem is, mister, I'm no jockey now, so I think I'll just be going..."

"I was there, Case; I was there when they invented your kind."

"You got zip to do with me and my kind buddy. You're rich enough to hire
expensive  razorgirls  to  haul  my  ass  up  here,  is  all.  I'm  never  gonna  punch
any deck again, not for you or anybody else." He crossed to the window and
looked down. "That's where I live now."

"Our profile says you're trying to con the street into killing you when you're
not looking."

"Profile?"

"We've  built  up  a  detailed  model.  Bought  a  go-to  for  each  of  your  aliases
and ran the skim through some military software. You're suicidal, Case. The
model  gives  you  a  month  on  the  outside.  And  our  medical  projection  says
you'll need a new pancreas inside a year."

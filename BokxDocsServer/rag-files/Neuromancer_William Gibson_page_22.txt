"And you wander back and forth in this portable bombshelter built of booze
and ups, sure. Proof against the grosser emotions, yes?"

"Why don't you get off my case, Ratz? You seen Wage?"

"Proof against fear and being alone," the bartender continued. "Listen to the
fear. Maybe it's your friend."

"You  hear  anything  about  a  fight  in  the  arcade  tonight,  Ratz?  Somebody
hurt?"

"Crazy cut a security man." He shrugged. "A girl, they say."

"I gotta talk to Wage. Ratz, I..."

"Ah."    Ratz's    mouth    narrowed,    compressed    into    a    single    line.    He    was
looking past Case, toward the entrance. "I think you are about to."

Case had a sudden flash of the shuriken in their window. The speed sang in
his head. The pistol in his hand was slippery with sweat.

"Herr   Wage,"   Ratz   said,   slowly   extending   his   pink   manipulator   as   if   he
expected it to be shaken. "How great a pleasure. Too seldom do you honor
us."

Case  turned  his  head  and  looked  up  into  Wage's  face.  It  was  a  tanned  and
forgettable   mask.   The   eyes   were   vatgrown   sea-green   Nikon   transplants.
Wage  wore  a  suit  of  gunmetal  silk  and  a  simple  bracelet  of  platinum  on
either  wrist.  He  was  flanked  by  his  joeboys,  nearly  identical  young  men,
their arms and shoulders bulging with grafted muscle.

"How you doing, Case?"

"Gentlemen,"  said  Ratz,  picking  up  the  table's  heaped  ashtray  in  his  pink
plastic   claw,   "I   want   no   trouble   here."   The   ashtray   was   made   of   thick,
shatterproof plastic, and advertised Tsingtao beer. Ratz crushed it smoothly,
butts     and     shards     of     green     plastic     cascading     onto     the     tabletop.     "You
understand?"

Maelcum kicked off and drifted past the pilot console, busying himself with
a      caulk      gun.      Case      hastily      looked      away      from      the      waving      fronds      of

length    of    silver    tape,    remembering    Molly's    story    of    her    day    in    Macao.
Armitage  had  crossed  the  border  into  Zhongshan.  "On,"  he  said,  changing

"Done."

He drummed his hands on the Ono-Sendai.

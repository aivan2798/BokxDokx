"Feel better?"

"To  know  what  they're  like.  You  were  starting  to  hate  my  guts  for  a  while
there. That's good. But hate them instead. Same difference."

"Listen,"  Case  said,  stepping  forward,  "they  never  did  shit  to  me.  You,  it's
different..." But he couldn't feel the anger.

"So T-A, they made me. The French girl, she said you were selling out the
species. Demon, she said I was." The Finn grinned. "It doesn't much matter.
You gotta hate somebody before this is over." He turned and headed for the
back  of  the  shop.  "Well,  come  on,  I'll  show  you  a  little  bit  of  Straylight
while   I   got   you   here."   He   lifted   the   corner   of   the   blanket.   White   light
poured out. "Shit, man, don't just stand there."

Case followed, rubbing his face.

"Okay," said the Finn, and grabbed his elbow.

They  were  drawn  past  the  stale  wool  in  a  puff  of  dust,  into  freefall  and  a
cylindrical corridor of fluted lunar concrete, ringed with white neon at two-
meter intervals.

"Jesus," Case said, tumbling.

"This   is   the   front   entrance,"   the   Finn   said,   his   tweed   flapping.   "If   this
weren't a construct of mine, where the shop is would be the main gate, up
by the Freeside axis. This'll all be a little low on detail, though, because you
don't have the memories. Except for this bit here, you got off Molly..."

Case managed to straighten out, but began to corkscrew in a long spiral.

"Hold on," the Finn said, "I'll fast-forward us."

The     walls     blurred.     Dizzying     sensation     of     headlong     movement,     colors,
whipping around corners and through narrow corridors. They seemed at one
point to pass through several meters of solid wall, a flash of pitch darkness.

"Here," the Finn said. "This is it."

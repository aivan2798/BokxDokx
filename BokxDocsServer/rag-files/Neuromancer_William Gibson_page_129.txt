"Do it again. Who owns Reinhold?"

It took three more jumps up the ladder before he reached Tessier-Ashpool.

"Dixie,"    he    said,    jacking    in,    "what    do    you    know    about    Chinese    virus
programs?"

"Not a whole hell of a lot."

"Ever hear of a grading system like Kuang, Mark Eleven?"

"No."

Case sighed. "Well, I got a user-friendly Chinese icebreaker here, a one shot
cassette. Some people in Frankfurt say it'll cut an AI."

"Possible. Sure. If it's military."

"Looks   like   it.   Listen,   Dix,   and   gimme   the   benefit   of   your   background,
okay?   Armitage   seems   to   be   setting   up   a   run   on   an   AI   that   belongs   to
Tessier-Ashpool. The mainframe's in Berne, but it's linked with another one
in  Rio.  The  one  in  Rio  is  the  one  that  flatlined  you,  that  first  time.  So  it
looks like they link via Straylight, the T-A home base, down the end of the
spindle, and we're supposed to cut our way in with the Chinese icebreaker.
So  if  Wintermute's  backing  the  whole  show,  it's  paying  us  to  burn  it.  It's
burning itself. And something that calls itself Wintermute is trying to get on
my good side, get me to maybe shaft Armitage. What goes?"

"Motive,"     the     construct     said.     "Real     motive     problem,     with     an     AI.     Not
human, see?"

"Well, yeah, obviously."

"Nope. I mean, it's not human. And you can't get a handle on it. Me, I'm not
human either, but I _respond_ like one. See?"

"Wait a sec," Case said. "Are you sentient, or not?"

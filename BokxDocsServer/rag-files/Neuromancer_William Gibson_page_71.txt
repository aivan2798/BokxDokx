border  into  place,  the  Finn  took  a  flat  little  console  from  his  pocket  and
punched out an elaborate sequence.

"Honey," he said to Molly, tucking the console away, "you have got it. No
shit, I can smell it. You wanna tell me where you got it?"

"Yonderboy,"  Molly  said,  shoving  the  herring  and  crackers  aside.  "I  did  a
deal with Larry, on the side."

"Smart," the Finn said. "It's an AI."

"Slow it down a little," Case said.

"Berne,"     the     Finn     said,     ignoring     him.     "Berne.     It's     got     limited     Swiss
citizenship    under    their    equivalent    of    the    Act    of    '53.    Built    for    Tessier-
Ashpool S.A. They own the mainframe and the original software."

"What's in Berne, okay?" Case deliberately stepped between them.

"Wintermute is the recognition code for an AI. I've got the Turing Registry
numbers. Artificial intelligence."

"That's all just fine," Molly said, "but where's it get us?"

"If Yonderboy's right," the Finn said, "this AI is backing Armitage."

"I  paid  Larry  to  have  the  Moderns  nose  around  Armitage  a  little,"  Molly
explained,       turning       to       Case.       "They       have       some       very       weird       lines       of
communication.    Deal    was,    they'd    get    my    money    if    they    answered    one
question: who's running Armitage?"

"And you think it's this AI? Those things aren't allowed any autonomy. It'll
be the parent corporation, this Tessle..."

"Tessier-Ashpool S.A.," said the Finn. "And I got a little story for you about
them. Wanna hear?" He sat down and hunched forward.

"Finn," Molly said. "He loves a story."

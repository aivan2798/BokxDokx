"No. Thanks. I want some help." He pushed the boy's arm aside and stepped
into the room.

"Hey, really, man, we're..."

"Going   to   help   me.   You're   really   glad   to   see   me.   Because   we're   friends,

Bruce blinked. "Sure."

Case recited the address the Flatline had given him.

"I knew he was a gangster," Cath called cheerfully from the shower.

"I gotta Honda trike," Bruce said, grinning vacantly.

"We go now," Case said.

"That    level's    the    cubicles,"    Bruce    said,    after    asking    Case    to    repeat    the

Case  turned  and  descended  a  spiral  staircase  of  floral  iron.  Six  turns  and

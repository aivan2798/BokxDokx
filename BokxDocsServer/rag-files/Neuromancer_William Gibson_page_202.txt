was      the      root      of      street      cool,      too,      the      knowing      posture      that      implied
connection, invisible lines up to hidden levels of influence.

But what was happening now, in the corridors of Villa Straylight?

Whole stretches were being stripped back to steel and concrete.

"Wonder   where   our   Peter   is   now,   huh?   Maybe   see   that   boy   soon,"   she
muttered. "And Armitage. Where's he, Case?"

"Dead," he said, knowing she couldn't hear him, "he's dead."

He flipped.

The   Chinese   program   was   face   to   face   with   the   target   ice,   rainbow   tints
gradually   dominated   by   the   green   of   the   rectangle   representing   the   T-A
cores. Arches of emerald across the colorless void.

"How's it go Dixie?"

"Fine. Too slick. Thing's amazing... Shoulda had one that time in Singapore.
Did the old New Bank of Asia for a good fiftieth of what they were worth.
But that's ancient history. This baby takes all the drudgery out of it. Makes
you wonder what a real war would be like, now..."

"If this kinda shit was on the street; we'd be out a job," Case said.

"You wish. Wait'll you're steering that thing upstairs through black ice."

"Sure."

Something  small  and  decidedly  nongeometric  had  just  appeared  on  the  far
end of one of the emerald arches.

"Dixie..."

"Yeah. I see it. Don't know if I believe it."

He stepped out into the street. The rain had stopped.

Ninsei was deserted.

Holograms   flickered,   neon   danced.   He   smelled   boiled   vegetables   from   a
vendor's pushcart across the street. An unopened pack of Yeheyuans lay at
his  feet,  beside  a  book  of  matches.  JULIUS  DEANE  IMPORT  EXPORT.
Case stared at the printed logo and its Japanese translation.

"Okay," he said, picking up the matches and opening the pack of cigarettes.
"I hear you."

He   took   his   time   climbing   the   stairs   of   Deane's   office.   No   rush,   he   told
himself,  no  hurry.  The  sagging  face  of  the  Dali  clock  still  told  the  wrong
time. There was dust on the Kandinsky table and the Neo-Aztec bookcases.
A wall of white fiberglass shipping modules filled the room with a smell of
ginger.

"Is the door locked?" Case waited for an answer, but none came. He crossed
to the office door and tried it. "Julie?"

The  green-shaded  brass  lamp  cast  a  circle  of  light  on  Deane's  desk.  Case
stared at the guts of an ancient typewriter, at cassettes, crumpled printouts,
at sticky plastic bags filled with ginger samples.

There was no one there.

Case  stepped  around  the  broad  steel  desk  and  pushed  Deane's  chair  out  of
the way. He found the gun in a cracked leather holster fastened beneath the
desk with silver tape. It was an antique, a .357 Magnum with the barrel and
trigger-guard  sawn  off.  The  grip  had  been  built  up  with  layers  of  masking
tape.  The  tape  was  old,  brown,  shiny  with  a  patina  of  dirt.  He  flipped  the
cylinder out and examined each of the six cartridges. They were handloads.
The soft lead was still bright and untarnished.

With the revolver in his right hand, Case edged past the cabinet to the left of
the  desk  and  stepped  into  the  center  of  the  cluttered  office,  away  from  the
pool of light.

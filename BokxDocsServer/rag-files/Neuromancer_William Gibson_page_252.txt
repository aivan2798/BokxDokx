And found himself staring down, through Molly's one good eye, at a white-
faced,    wasted    figure,    afloat    in    a    loose    fetal    crouch,    a    cyberspace    deck
between  its  thighs,  a  band  of  silver  trodes  above  closed,  shadowed  eyes.
The man's cheeks were hollowed with a day's growth of dark beard, his face
slick with sweat.

He was looking at himself.

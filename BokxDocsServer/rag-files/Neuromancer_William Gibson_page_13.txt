"What   brings   you   around,   boyo?"   Deane   asked,   offering   Case   a   narrow
bonbon   wrapped   in   blue-and-white   checked   paper.   "Try   one.   Ting   Ting
Djahe,   the   very   best."   Case   refused   the   ginger,   took   a   seat   in   a   yawing
wooden  swivel  chair,  and  ran  a  thumb  down  the  faded  seam  of  one  black
jeans-leg. "Julie, I hear Wage wants to kill me."

"Ah. Well then. And where did you hear this, if I may?"

"People."

"People,"    Deane    said,    around    a    ginger    bonbon.    "What    sort    of    people?
Friends?"

Case nodded.

"Not always that easy to know who your friends are, is it?"

"I do owe him a little money, Deane. He say anything to you?"

"Haven't   been   in   touch,   of   late."   Then   he   sighed.   "If   I   _did_   know,   of
course, I might not be in a position to tell you. Things being what they are,
you understand."

"Things?"

"He's an important connection, Case."

"Yeah. He want to kill me, Julie?"

"Not that I know of." Deane shrugged. They might have been discussing the
price of ginger. "If it proves to be an unfounded rumor, old son, you come
back    in    a    week    or    so    and    I'll    let    you    in    on    a    little    something    out    of
Singapore."

"Out of the Nan Hai Hotel, Bencoolen Street?"

"Loose  lips,  old  son!"  Deane  grinned.  The  steel  desk  was  jammed  with  a
fortune in debugging gear.

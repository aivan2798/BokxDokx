"No,   we   got   the   boss's   usual   little   kink   in   the   plans,   you   know?   We're
getting this taxi out to Zion, Zion cluster." She touched the release plate on
her harness and began to free herself from the embrace of the foam. "Funny
choice of venue, you ask me."

"How's that?"

"Dreads. Rastas. Colony's about thirty years old now."

"What's that mean?"

"You'll  see.  It's  an  okay  place  by  me.  Anyway,  they'll  let  you  smoke  your
cigarettes there."

Zion   had   been   founded   by   five   workers   who'd   refused   to   return,   who'd
turned their backs on the well and started building. They'd suffered calcium

shoving his legs into a narrow hatchway overhead. "Grab the rungs. Make
like  you're  climbing  backward,  right?  You're  going  toward  the  hull,  that's
like you're climbing down into gravity. Got it?"

Case's stomach churned.

"You be fine, mon," Aerol said, his grin bracketed with gold incisors.

Somehow, the end of the tunnel had become its bottom. Case embraced the
weak gravity like a drowning man finding a pocket of air.

"Up," Molly said, "you gonna kiss it next?" Case lay flat on the deck, on his
stomach,   arms   spread.   Something   struck   him   on   the   shoulder.   He   rolled

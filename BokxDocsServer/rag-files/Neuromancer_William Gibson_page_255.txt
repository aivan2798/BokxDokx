And here things could be counted, each one. He knew the number of grains
of  sand  in  the  construct  of  the  beach  (a  number  coded  in  a  mathematical
system  that  existed  nowhere  outside  the  mind  that  was  Neuromancer).  He
knew the number of yellow food packets in the canisters in the bunker (four
hundred  and  seven).  He  knew  the  number  of  brass  teeth  in  the  left  half  of
the open zipper of the salt-crusted leather jacket that Linda Lee wore as she
trudged  along  the  sunset  beach,  swinging  a  stick  of  driftwood  in  her  hand
(two hundred and two).

He banked Kuang above the beach and swung the program in a wide circle,
seeing the black shark thing through her eyes, a silent ghost hungry against
the  banks  of  lowering  cloud.  She  cringed,  dropping  her  stick,  and  ran.  He
knew  the  rate  of  her  pulse,  the  length  of  her  stride  in  measurements  that
would have satisfied the most exacting standards of geophysics.

"But  you  do  not  know  her  thoughts,"  the  boy  said,  beside  him  now  in  the
shark thing's heart. "I do not know her thoughts. You were wrong, Case. To
live here is to live. There is no difference."

Linda in her panic, plunging blind through the surf.

"Stop her," he said, "she'll hurt herself."

"I can't stop her," the boy said, his gray eyes mild and beautiful.

"You've got Riviera's eyes," Case said.

There  was  a  flash  of  white  teeth,  long  pink  gums.  "But  not  his  craziness.
Because they are beautiful to me." He shrugged. "I need no mask to speak
with you. Unlike my brother. I create my own personality. Personality is my
medium."

Case took them up, a steep climb, away from the beach and the frightened
girl.  "Why'd  you  throw  her  up  to  me,  you  little  prick?  Over  and  fucking
over, and turning me around. You killed her, huh? In Chiba."

"No," the boy said.
